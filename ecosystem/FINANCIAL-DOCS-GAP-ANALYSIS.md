# Financial Documentation Gap Analysis & Investor-Readiness Framework

**What secondary documents do we need? How do we get granular enough to answer investor and donor questions?**

*Working Document | February 2026*

---

## Part 1: Secondary Financial Documents Needed

The ecosystem has strong narrative and strategic documentation (executive summaries, the PPP Financial Model, investor pitches, the fundraising roadmap). What's missing are the **underlying financial records, assumptions, and operational details** that sophisticated investors and institutional donors will ask for before writing checks -- especially at the $1M+ level.

Below is organized by priority tier.

---

### Tier 1: Must-Have Before Major Fundraising Conversations

These are the documents that any serious funder (impact investor, foundation program officer, family office) will expect to see or will ask about directly.

#### 1. Actual Financial Statements for Kinship Earth (501c3)

**What's needed:**
- Balance sheet (assets, liabilities, net assets) -- even a simple one
- Income statement / statement of activities (revenue vs. expenses, by category)
- Cash flow statement (where money came in, where it went out, what's left)
- Covering at minimum the period from when Flow Funding launched (mid-2024) through present

**Why it matters:** The ecosystem quotes "$800K+ raised" and "$370K+ deployed" -- funders will want to see this substantiated in actual accounting records, not just narrative. This is the single most important credibility document for Kinship Earth because it proves the numbers in the executive summary are real.

**Format:** Doesn't need to be audited yet. A CPA-prepared compilation or internally-prepared financial statements using standard nonprofit accounting (GAAP basis or cash basis) are sufficient at this stage.

#### 2. Form 990 Tax Returns

**What's needed:**
- Kinship Earth Form 990 (or 990-PF for private foundations) for the most recent completed fiscal year
- Permatours Form 990 for the most recent completed fiscal year

**Why it matters:** 990s are public documents. Institutional funders and foundation program officers will look these up on GuideStar/Candid. If they can't find them, or if the numbers don't match your narrative, it raises questions. If either entity is too new or too small for a full 990, the 990-N (e-Postcard) or 990-EZ should be on file.

#### 3. Detailed Operating Budgets (12-24 Month)

**What's needed:** A line-item budget for each entity showing monthly or quarterly projected expenses and revenue for the next 12-24 months. Not phase-level aggregates -- actual operational line items.

**Per entity, this should include:**

| Category | Line Items to Show |
|---|---|
| **Personnel** | Each role, compensation rate (hourly/monthly/annual), FTE equivalent, benefits if any |
| **Professional services** | Legal, accounting, consulting -- with named firms or rate estimates |
| **Program delivery** | Cost per event, cost per bioregion activation, cost per Flow Funder cohort |
| **Technology** | Software subscriptions, platform development costs, hosting |
| **Travel** | Per-trip estimates, number of trips, purpose |
| **Occupancy** | Office/co-working, storage, meeting space |
| **Insurance** | D&O, general liability, event insurance |
| **Fundraising costs** | Platform fees, donor cultivation, events, materials |
| **Administrative** | Banking, bookkeeping, filing fees, supplies |

**Why it matters:** The current documents show budget *ranges* at the phase level ($180K-$230K for Phase 1). Funders want to see the actual line items. A foundation program officer reviewing a $250K grant request needs to see exactly how that money gets spent month by month.

#### 4. Cash Flow Projection & Runway Analysis

**What's needed:**
- Monthly cash flow projection for each entity (12-24 months)
- Current cash on hand / bank balance
- Monthly burn rate
- Months of runway at current burn rate
- Capital infusion triggers (when does each entity run out of money without new funding?)

**Why it matters:** Investors and major donors need to understand urgency and timing. "We need $5M by 2026" is a target. "We have 4 months of runway and need $180K by June to maintain operations" is actionable. The cash flow projection makes the ask concrete.

#### 5. Detailed Funding History & Pipeline

**What's needed:**

A table showing every significant funding event:

| Date | Source | Amount | Type | Status | Restrictions | Entity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Example | Novo Foundation | $150,000 | Foundation grant | Received | Unrestricted | Kinship Earth |
| Example | Individual donor | $25,000 | Individual gift | Received | Flow Funding | Kinship Earth |

Plus a pipeline document showing:
- Active grant applications (where, how much, timeline, probability)
- Donor cultivation conversations in progress
- Expected revenue from events or earned income
- Total pipeline value and weighted probability

**Why it matters:** Funders want to know who else is funding this, what the momentum is, and whether there's a credible path to the target. Showing a real pipeline demonstrates fundraising capacity, not just aspiration.

---

### Tier 2: Needed Before Closing Investments or Large Grants ($500K+)

#### 6. Legal Entity Structure & Relationship Map

**What's needed:**
- Formal organizational chart showing all entities (Kinship Earth, Permatours, Na'luea Living Trust, any future PPP entity, Unified Sanctuaries CLT)
- Legal relationship between them (fiscal sponsorship agreements, MOUs, board overlaps)
- Who can receive what type of capital (donations, investments, earned revenue)
- Where intellectual property lives
- Who employs or contracts which team members

**Why it matters:** The ecosystem is complex -- four initiatives, multiple legal entities, fiscal sponsorship relationships, a living trust. An investor needs to understand exactly where their money goes and which entity holds liability. A foundation needs to verify 501c3 status and ensure their grant flows through a qualified entity.

#### 7. Compensation & Staffing Plan

**What's needed:**
- Current team members, their roles across entities, and their current compensation (including $0 if volunteer/unpaid)
- Planned compensation as funding arrives (roles, rates, FTE)
- Total annual payroll cost at each funding scenario ($200K, $600K, $1.5M)
- Retroactive compensation plan -- who is owed what for pre-funding labor, and on what terms

**Why it matters:** "Retroactive & bridging labor recognition: $30,000" is a line item in the PPP budget. Funders will ask: who specifically, how much each, and what's the basis for those amounts? More broadly, funders want to know that leadership is compensated sustainably (to reduce burnout risk) but not excessively (mission alignment).

#### 8. Flow Funding Deployment Tracker

**What's needed:**
- Each of the 23 Flow Funders: name (or anonymized identifier), bioregion, amount received, date deployed, reported outcomes
- Aggregate data: average grant size, median grant size, range, geographic distribution
- Outcome categories: what types of projects were funded, what results were reported
- Renewal data: which Flow Funders are being renewed and why

**Why it matters:** This is Kinship Earth's core proof of concept. "$370K+ deployed to 23 Flow Funders" needs to be backed up with a tracker that shows the distribution, timing, and outcomes. Foundation program officers will want this level of detail. It also becomes the basis for impact reporting and case studies that support future fundraising.

#### 9. Fiscal Sponsorship Agreements

**What's needed:**
- The actual MOU or fiscal sponsorship agreement between Kinship Earth and PPP
- Any agreements between Kinship Earth and other sponsored projects
- Terms: who controls funds, reporting requirements, fee structure, termination provisions

**Why it matters:** When capital flows through a fiscal sponsor, the sponsor's agreement defines who has authority over the funds. Investors and institutional donors will want to see these agreements to verify that governance is real, not just described.

#### 10. Board Meeting Minutes & Resolutions

**What's needed:**
- Kinship Earth board meeting minutes (at least the most recent 2-3 meetings)
- Board resolutions approving major grants, fiscal sponsorship arrangements, and strategic decisions
- Evidence that the board is active and exercising oversight

**Why it matters:** A private foundation's board has fiduciary duties. Funders (especially other foundations) will want evidence of active governance. If the board has approved the Flow Funding strategy, the PPP fiscal sponsorship, and the major grant deployments, those resolutions should be documented and available.

---

### Tier 3: Needed for Specific Capital Types

#### 11. For Impact Investors: SPV Term Sheet & Legal Structure

**What's needed:**
- Draft or model term sheet for the SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) described in the PPP Financial Model
- Legal opinion or memo on the commons-aligned trust structure
- Specific terms: return cap percentage, revenue share mechanics, timeline, exit provisions, reporting obligations
- Securities law compliance memo (are these securities? What exemptions apply?)

**Why it matters:** The Financial Model describes an investment vehicle, but there is no term sheet or legal structure to review. An impact investor cannot evaluate a deal without seeing actual terms. The SPV concept is compelling but needs to be translated into a legal instrument.

#### 12. For Unified Sanctuaries: Property Pro Forma

**What's needed:**
- Target property profiles (2-3 specific campus properties with asking prices, acreage, building inventory)
- Acquisition cost estimate (purchase price, closing costs, legal fees, due diligence)
- Renovation/adaptation budget per building (what needs work, what's move-in ready)
- Operating pro forma: monthly revenue and expense projections for each pillar, by year, for 5 years
- Staffing plan for the village operation (who runs the farm, the retreat center, the event venue, the housing)

**Why it matters:** The Investor Business Plan is compelling but operates at the conceptual level. An investor evaluating a $10M capital deployment needs to see a specific property (or a representative comparable), specific renovation estimates, and a detailed operating pro forma -- not ranges like "$315K to $1M+/year" without the underlying assumptions.

#### 13. For Government Grants: Logic Models & Theory of Change

**What's needed:**
- Standard logic model (inputs -> activities -> outputs -> outcomes -> impact) for each entity
- Theory of change narrative aligned to specific funding programs (USDA, USAID, state community development)
- Evaluation plan: what data will be collected, how, by whom, how reported

**Why it matters:** Government grants require formal program design documentation. The current materials are narrative-strong but don't use the frameworks that government program officers evaluate against.

---

## Part 2: Getting More Granular -- Assumptions & Unit Economics

The biggest gap in the current financial model is not the projections themselves -- it's the **documented assumptions** behind them. When an investor or donor asks "How did you arrive at that number?", every projection needs a traceable answer.

Below is a framework for building out the assumptions layer, organized by entity.

---

### Kinship Earth -- Key Questions to Answer with Data

| Question an Investor/Donor Will Ask | What You Need to Document |
|---|---|
| What's your cost per Flow Funder? | Total cost to identify, onboard, deploy, and support one Flow Funder through a full cycle (including staff time, travel, communications). Break this into: direct grant amount + overhead per grant. |
| What's your overhead ratio? | Administrative costs / total expenditures. Foundations benchmark this. Under 20% is strong for a grantmaker. |
| What's your donor acquisition cost? | How much does it cost (in time, events, materials, travel) to cultivate a new major donor? What's the average gift size? What's the conversion rate from prospect to donor? |
| What's the donor retention rate? | Of your existing donors, what percentage give again? (The Novo Foundation renewed -- that's great data. Document it.) |
| How does capital deployment scale? | If you go from 23 Flow Funders to 100, does overhead scale linearly or are there efficiencies? Model this. |
| What happens if a Flow Funder misuses funds? | What's the accountability mechanism? Has it been triggered? What are the safeguards? (This isn't financial data but donors will ask.) |

**Action:** Build a **Kinship Earth Unit Economics Dashboard** showing: cost per grant deployed, overhead ratio, donor acquisition cost, donor retention rate, average grant size, and deployment velocity (grants per quarter).

---

### PPP -- Key Questions to Answer with Data

The PPP Financial Model is the most developed, but the assumptions behind the revenue projections need substantiation.

#### Event & Festival Revenue

| Assumption | What to Document |
|---|---|
| Year 1: $50K event revenue | How many events? Average attendance? Average ticket price? Average cost per event? Net margin per event? |
| Year 3: $350K event revenue | How many events at that scale? Are these PPP-produced or revenue-share from bioregional events? What's the scaling path from 2 events to 20? |
| Year 5: $900K event revenue | What does a "global federation of festivals" look like economically? How many events, at what scale, with what revenue model? |

**Action:** Build an **Event Revenue Model** spreadsheet with: events per year, average attendance, ticket price tiers, cost per event (venue, production, facilitation, travel, food, marketing), net revenue per event, and scaling assumptions.

#### Platform & Certification Fees

| Assumption | What to Document |
|---|---|
| Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard: $100K-$200K/yr revenue by Year 3 | Who pays for dashboard access? What's the pricing model (per user, per bioregion, tiered)? What's the addressable market (how many bioregions, organizations, researchers)? What's the adoption curve? |
| Learning platforms & certification: $150K-$300K/yr by Year 3 | What certifications? What price per certification? How many learners per year? What's the completion rate? What comparable platforms charge? |
| Toolkits & playbooks: $50K-$100K/yr by Year 3 | Licensing to whom? At what price? Is this B2B (sold to organizations) or B2C (sold to practitioners)? |

**Action:** For each investable asset, build a **Revenue Assumptions Sheet** showing: target customer, pricing model, addressable market size, penetration rate assumption, revenue per customer, and comparable benchmarks from similar platforms.

#### Community Currency Transaction Fees

| Assumption | What to Document |
|---|---|
| Transaction fee revenue: $50K-$200K/yr by Year 3 | What's the projected transaction volume? At what fee rate (1-3%)? How many active users? Average transactions per user per month? What drives adoption? |

**Action:** Model the **community currency economics** separately: minting volume, circulation velocity, transaction volume, fee structure, and adoption curve by bioregion.

#### Bioregion Activation Costs

| Assumption | What to Document |
|---|---|
| $250K per bioregion (Year 1) declining to $160K (Year 3) | What's the basis for the $250K figure? Is it based on actual spending in Colombia and Jamaica? If so, show the actuals. If projected, show the build-up. |
| Cost reduction to $200K (Year 2) and $160K (Year 3) | What specifically gets cheaper? Which line items decrease and by how much? What evidence supports the decline rate? |

**Action:** Build a **Bioregion Activation Pro Forma** using actual data from Colombia and Jamaica as the baseline, showing: what was actually spent, what was budgeted, variance analysis, and projected costs for next bioregion incorporating lessons learned.

---

### Permatours -- Key Questions to Answer with Data

| Question | What to Document |
|---|---|
| What's the revenue per event? | Break down by event type: work day (donation-based), paid workshop, festival. Average revenue, average cost, net per event. |
| What's the cost to activate a chapter? | Travel, setup, mentoring, materials, legal (fiscal sponsorship). What does Year 1 look like for a chapter? |
| How does the tokenomics model generate actual revenue? | The utility token is pegged at $1 and non-liquid. Where does real revenue come from? Transaction fees? Marketplace commissions? Workshop fees paid in tokens that are then redeemed? |
| What's your volunteer-to-dollar leverage ratio? | How many volunteer hours per event? What's the economic value of that labor? This is a powerful impact metric for grant applications. |

**Action:** Build a **Permatours Event Economics Model** and a **Chapter Activation Cost Model** using real data from 50+ events.

---

### Unified Sanctuaries -- Key Questions to Answer with Data

This is the entity with the largest capital ask ($10M Phase 1, $100M Phase 2) and the least financial granularity. It needs the most work.

#### Revenue Assumptions by Pillar

For each of the four pillars, an investor will want to see:

**1. Permaculture Farm & Education ($315K-$1M+/yr)**

| Revenue Stream | Assumptions Needed |
|---|---|
| Farm stand sales | Acreage under cultivation, crop mix, yield per acre, pricing, seasonal calendar, comparable farm stand revenue in Vermont |
| Community cafe | Seating capacity, covers per day, average check, days open, food cost %, labor cost % |
| Agritourism (U-pick, farm dinners) | Events per season, capacity, pricing, comparable operations |
| Workshops & forest school | Programs per month, enrollment, pricing, instructor costs |
| CSA / wholesale | Members or accounts, price per share/unit, fulfillment costs |

**2. Retreat & Healing Arts ($570K-$1.75M/yr)**

| Revenue Stream | Assumptions Needed |
|---|---|
| Retreat programming | Retreats per year, capacity per retreat, price per person per night, occupancy rate, cost per retreat (facilitator, food, linens, cleaning) |
| Day programs (somatic therapy, art therapy) | Sessions per week, price per session, practitioner compensation model |
| Bathhouse / spa | Daily capacity, price per visit/treatment, operating hours, staffing, comparable spa revenue in rural Vermont |
| Campground | Sites, nightly rate, seasonal occupancy, comparable campground rates |

**3. Event Venue ($310K-$1.16M/yr)**

| Revenue Stream | Assumptions Needed |
|---|---|
| Weddings | Events per year, average wedding spend at venue, seasonal distribution, comparable venue pricing in Southern Vermont |
| Festivals & concerts | Events per year, attendance, ticket price, artist/production costs, vendor revenue |
| Conferences & retreats (external rental) | Bookings per year, daily/weekly rate, catering revenue, comparable conference center rates |
| AV/multimedia production | Clients, project pricing, studio utilization |

**4. Community Living ($195K-$580K/yr)**

| Revenue Stream | Assumptions Needed |
|---|---|
| Housing fees | Number of units, monthly fee, occupancy rate, comparable co-housing/cooperative fees in Vermont |
| Membership dues | Number of members, monthly/annual dues, what's included |
| Stewardship contributions | What this means financially, how it's structured |

**Action:** For each pillar, build a **detailed revenue model** with specific, defensible assumptions. Reference comparable operations in Vermont and New England. An investor evaluating a $10M deployment needs to see that the $1.4M Year 1 revenue projection is built from the bottom up, not estimated from the top down.

#### Property-Specific Analysis

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| Target property profiles | 2-3 specific properties or comparable campuses with: location, acreage, building inventory (sq ft per building, condition), asking price, tax assessment, zoning |
| Acquisition budget | Purchase price + closing costs + legal + environmental assessment + due diligence |
| Renovation budget | Per-building: what needs repair/upgrade, estimated cost, timeline, contractor approach |
| Operating cost estimate | Annual: property taxes, insurance (liability, property, D&O), utilities, maintenance, groundskeeping, staffing |
| Comparable transactions | Other university campus conversions or large rural property acquisitions in New England -- what they cost, what they became |

---

### Cross-Ecosystem: Sensitivity Analysis

**What's needed:** A document (or spreadsheet tab) showing what happens to each entity and the ecosystem if:

| Scenario | Variables to Model |
|---|---|
| Fundraising comes in at 50% of target | Which activities get cut? In what order? What's the minimum viable scope? |
| Fundraising comes in at 75% of target | Can all entities survive? Which phases get delayed? |
| A key funder pulls out (e.g., Novo doesn't renew) | What's the revenue concentration risk? |
| Bioregion activations cost 2x projected | How many bioregions can be activated? Does the model still work? |
| Earned revenue takes 2 years longer than projected | What's the additional philanthropic capital needed to bridge? |
| Syd is unable to lead for 6+ months | What's the continuity plan? Who steps in? (Key-person risk) |

**Why it matters:** Investors stress-test models. Having the downside scenarios already modeled shows financial sophistication and reduces perceived risk. It's better for *you* to present the downside case than for an investor to discover it themselves.

---

## Part 3: Recommended Document Creation Sequence

Based on what's most likely to be requested first and what builds on what:

### Immediate (Next 30 Days)

1. **Kinship Earth financial statements** (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow) -- this is the foundation everything else rests on
2. **Cash flow projection & runway analysis** for each active entity
3. **Flow Funding deployment tracker** with all 23 Flow Funders
4. **Detailed 12-month operating budget** for Kinship Earth and PPP

### Near-Term (30-90 Days)

5. **Compensation & staffing plan** across all entities
6. **Legal entity structure diagram** with all relationships formalized
7. **Funding history table** and active pipeline
8. **PPP event revenue model** with bottom-up assumptions
9. **PPP investable asset revenue assumptions sheets**
10. **Kinship Earth unit economics dashboard** (cost per grant, overhead ratio, etc.)

### Before Closing Major Investments (90-180 Days)

11. **SPV term sheet and legal structure** for impact investment vehicle
12. **Unified Sanctuaries property pro forma** with specific campus targets
13. **Unified Sanctuaries pillar-by-pillar revenue model** with comparable benchmarks

17. **Quarterly financial dashboards** for all stakeholders
18. **Annual impact reports** with quantitative metrics
19. **Government grant logic models and evaluation plans**
20. **Updated Form 990s** filed on time annually

---

## Part 4: Practical Tips for Investor/Donor Conversations

### What Different Funders Will Ask For

| Funder Type | Primary Questions | Documents They'll Want |
|---|---|---|
| **Foundation program officer** | "What's your overhead ratio? How do you measure impact? Who else is funding you?" | 990, financial statements, impact data, other funder list, logic model |
| **Family office / HNWI donor** | "Tell me about the team. What's your track record? Where does my money go?" | Executive summary, team bios, deployment tracker, budget, impact stories |
| **Impact investor** | "What's the return structure? What's the risk? When do I get paid back? What's the legal vehicle?" | Term sheet, financial model with assumptions, SPV docs, legal opinion, sensitivity analysis |
| **DAF / donor-advised fund** | "Is this a 501c3? Can I get a tax receipt? What's my gift restricted to?" | IRS determination letter, 990, fiscal sponsorship agreement, gift acknowledgment process |
| **Government grant maker** | "What are your measurable outcomes? What's your evaluation methodology?" | Logic model, evaluation plan, organizational capacity statement, financial statements, 990 |
| **Aligned land investor (Unified Sanctuaries)** | "Show me the property. Show me the numbers. Who's managing operations?" | Property pro forma, operating budget, staffing plan, management team, comparable transactions, CLT legal structure |

### Building a "Data Room"

Consider assembling all of these documents into a shared, organized folder (a "data room") that can be shared with serious funders. Structure it like:

```
/Data Room
  /1-Entity-Overview
    Legal entity structure diagram
    IRS determination letters
    Fiscal sponsorship agreements
    Board member list
  /2-Financials
    Kinship Earth financial statements
    Kinship Earth 990
    Permatours 990
    Operating budgets (all entities)
    Cash flow projections
    Funding history & pipeline
  /3-Impact-Data
    Flow Funding deployment tracker
    Permatours event data
    Bioregion activation reports
    Impact metrics dashboard
  /4-Investment-Materials
    PPP Financial Model
    SPV term sheet (when ready)
    Sensitivity analysis
    Revenue assumptions sheets
  /5-Unified-Sanctuaries
    Property profiles
    Revenue pro formas by pillar
    Renovation budgets
    Comparable analysis
  /6-Governance
    Board meeting minutes
    Governance charters
    MOUs between entities
    Compensation plan
  /7-Pitch-Materials
    Executive summaries
    Investor pitch
    Fundraising roadmap
```

---

## Summary

**The narrative is strong. The vision is clear. The track record is real.** What's needed now is the financial scaffolding that translates narrative into numbers that funders can evaluate, stress-test, and say yes to.

The most urgent items are:
1. Actual financial statements for Kinship Earth (proving the $800K raised / $370K deployed)
2. Cash flow projections showing runway and burn rate
3. Flow Funding deployment tracker (the proof-of-concept data)
4. Bottom-up revenue assumptions for every projection in the financial model

Every number in the existing documents should be traceable to either an actual financial record or a clearly documented assumption. That traceability is what turns a compelling story into a fundable proposition.
