# Ecosystem Overview

> *How four initiatives at different scales -- from local land stewardship to global coordination -- form a coherent arc of regenerative systems change.*

## The Four Initiatives

| Initiative | Scale | Core Question | Status |
|------------|-------|---------------|--------|
| [**Kinship Earth**](../kinship-earth/) | Global | How does money move differently? | Active -- 18+ Flow Funders across 12+ bioregions |
| [**Planetary Party**](../planetary-party/) | Global | How do we coordinate without centralizing? | Active -- 5+ bioregional deployments |
| [**Permatours**](../permatours/) | Northeast Bioregion | How do people learn and build together? | Active -- 50+ events, 40+ project sites |
| [**Unified Sanctuaries**](../unified-sanctuaries/) | Local (Southern VT) | What does this look like when rooted in land? | Pre-acquisition / Planning |

Together, they address the full spectrum of what regenerative transformation requires: **capital**, **coordination**, **capacity**, and **place**. They are nested, permeable systems -- not a circular pipeline. Each weaves with many other organizations, people, and ecosystems beyond this constellation.

All four are stewarded by **Syd Harvey Griffith** -- community organizer, movement builder, regenerative finance leader, and Executive Director of Kinship Earth.

## How They Relate

These initiatives are deeply related but are **not a closed loop**. They operate at different scales, serve different purposes, and maintain ethical boundaries -- especially around funding. Each weaves with many other organizations, communities, and initiatives beyond Syd's direct orbit.

```

**Design principle:** These four are not a closed system where everything feeds everything else. Each maintains its own integrity, communities, and ethical boundaries -- especially around funding.

## Combined Capital Strategy

| Initiative | Near-Term Target | Medium-Term Target |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Kinship Earth** | $2M by end of 2026 | $20M by 2028 |
| **Planetary Party** | $5M by end of 2026 | $20M by 2028 |
| **Permatours** | $1M by end of 2026 | -- |
| **Unified Sanctuaries** | $10M by end of 2026 | $100M by 2028 |

## Connective Tissue: Live with Syd

Live with Syd is the nervous system that weaves the four initiatives together through weekly co-creative sessions:

| Day | Theme | Initiative Served |
|-----|-------|-------------------|
| **Monday** | Regenerative Capital Flows | Kinship Earth |
| **Wednesday** | Planetary Party Ecosystem | Planetary Party |
| **Friday** | Unified Sanctuaries Development | Unified Sanctuaries |
| **Monthly** | Heart Sharing & Grief Transmutation | Whole ecosystem |
