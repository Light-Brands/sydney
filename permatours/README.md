## Executive Summary

Permatours is a Northeast-based permaculture action, education, and mutual aid network that activates people to learn by doing while strengthening land-based community hubs across the bioregion. Founded and led by Syd Harvey Griffith, Permatours has co-created **50+ learn-by-doing events** across **40+ land-based project sites** since 2021, building a mycelial network of communities, organizers, educators, and volunteers dedicated to regenerating ecosystems, empowering local stewardship, and addressing essential needs: food, water, shelter, energy, and belonging.

Permatours is not a single place or a traditional nonprofit program. It is a **living network** -- a capacity-builder and mobilizer that flows resources outward to the communities it serves. It connects permaculture practitioners, land projects, and aligned organizations through hands-on action: natural building workshops, food forest installations, herbal education, community festivals, skill-shares, and mutual aid coordination. Every event is documented, creating an ongoing body of educational media and storytelling that amplifies impact and inspires replication.

### The Core Purpose

To support people in learning how to meet their basic needs in alignment with their values, with the support of community, land, and shared responsibility -- reducing dependency on extractive or misaligned systems and returning to ways of living that genuinely nourish people and place.

Permatours exists to help people:

- **Rebuild practical life skills** -- food production, natural building, care, energy systems, collaboration
- **Experience community-supported living** -- what it means to be held by a network instead of dependent on institutions
- **Reconnect with land-based, relational ways of living** -- rooted in place, season, and reciprocity
- **Transition from passive participation to active stewardship** -- moving from consuming within broken systems toward co-creating resilient alternatives

This is not about isolation or rejection of society. It is about **choice, resilience, and dignity** -- remembering how to care for ourselves and one another in ways that feel whole.

### What Permatours Has Built (2021-2025)

Over four years, Permatours has cultivated a bioregional network spanning New England and the broader Northeast, partnering with regenerative projects including Sacred Nectar Sanctuary (NH), Diggers Co-Op (ME), Rooted Heart Farm (ME), Wild Island Center (ME), Blackbirds Daughter Botanicals (NH), Orange Peel Bakery (Martha's Vineyard, MA), and dozens of community land trusts, urban farms, and homesteads. Programming has included:

- Natural building workshops (cob ovens, hempcrete structures, A-frame tiny homes, earthen construction)
- Permaculture design and food forest installations
- Bioconstruction immersions (including international collaborations in Chiapas, Mexico)
- Hemp building and fiber systems workshops
- Plant walks, herbal wisdom circles, and medicinal cultivation
- Water systems creation and ecological restoration
- Community festivals, convergences, and ceremonial gatherings
- The Northeast Eco Communities Convergence
- Skill-sharing, volunteer coordination, and mutual aid rapid response

The network now includes 2,000 email subscribers and 1,000 active members, with a proven model for mobilizing volunteers, coordinating land-based projects, and co-creating educational experiences that build real capacity.

## The Next Evolution

Permatours is evolving from a small team of under-resourced organizers into a **decentralized mutual aid network** -- one where the work is held and stewarded by the collective, not dependent on paid staff. This evolution has three interconnected dimensions:

### 1. Mutual Aid Network

Permatours is restructuring into a distributed network of autonomous working circles:

- **Event Production & Logistics** -- co-creating the hands-on events that are Permatours' heartbeat
- **Communications & Storytelling** -- documenting impact and amplifying partner communities
- **Conflict Resolution & Care** -- trained mediators, accountability processes, community repair
- **Grant Writing & Resource Mobilization** -- unlocking funding and flowing it to community hubs
- **Mutual Aid & Rapid Response** -- pre-vetted volunteers, shared asset maps, emergency coordination for climate and social crises
- **Education & Skill-Sharing** -- curriculum development, educator coordination, knowledge exchange

Each circle operates within shared agreements (the Permatours Covenant) while self-organizing around its purpose. A consistent event rhythm (e.g., every other weekend), transparent governance via community assemblies, and clear host criteria ensure coherence without centralized control. The goal: **distribute responsibility so the network sustains itself beyond any individual organizer.**

### 2. Regenerative Tokenomics

Permatours has developed a dual-token system designed to recognize contributions, coordinate participation, and enable shared exchange -- without speculation or extraction:

**Utility Tokens (UT)** -- Community currency (1 UT = $1 USD, non-liquid) for marketplace trades, workshop access, skill exchanges, and mutual aid. Immediately earnable and spendable by anyone through verified labor: event participation, teaching, care work, remote contributions, and circle-defined tasks.

**Voice Tokens (VT)** -- Non-transferable governance tokens representing trust, consistency, and active participation. Used for voting on proposals and network decisions. Earnable only by Members (3+ events attended, 3 vouches from existing members). Capped at 40 VT per person with 20% seasonal decay -- ensuring governance power reflects current participation, not historical accumulation.

**Key design principles:**
- Economic power (UT), governance power (VT), and cultural reputation are intentionally separated to prevent concentration
- Anti-speculation safeguards: UT cannot convert to cash; VT cannot be traded; transfer limits prevent wealth hoarding
- Seasonal assemblies review supply, marketplace health, and rotate roles
- A Commons Treasury funded by voluntary contributions, event fees, and marketplace transactions supports shared needs
- Six core circles (Builders, Weavers, Storytellers, Resource Stewards, Governance/Evolution, Care Stewards) provide organizational structure
- A quest system enables any member to propose and complete valued work with peer verification

This tokenomics model is designed to be **expandable as a Northeast bioregional token** and adaptable as a blueprint for other bioregions -- prioritizing utility and governance over speculation.

### 3. Chapters Model

Permatours is developing a replicable chapters model so communities can adapt the Permatours approach locally while staying connected to the broader network. The model envisions:

- **Local chapters** activated by volunteer point-people who steward day-to-day logistics in their bioregion
- **Shared infrastructure** -- access to Permatours' 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship, volunteer database, Discord coordination, marketing tools, and educational resources
- **Three activation pathways**: consulting support for existing projects, backend production assistance for events, and co-hosted pilot events that seed new chapters
- **Hub criteria** -- partner sites provide access to affordable housing or stays, offer healthy food and nourishment, host educational or community-centered gatherings, demonstrate regenerative practices, and serve community benefit
- **Global applicability** -- while currently Northeast-focused, the chapters model is designed to serve bioregions around the world by activating volunteers to build local, regenerative community hubs

## Project Plan

1. **Support hands-on, land-based learning** that helps people meet basic needs (food, shelter, care) in alignment with their values
2. **Strengthen community-led mutual aid** -- distributing leadership and reducing reliance on extractive systems
3. **Deploy regenerative tokenomics** to recognize contributions, coordinate participation, and support shared exchange without speculation
4. **Collect and share impact data** with partner communities to unlock larger grant opportunities and access carbon and biodiversity credit markets
5. **Build a Northeast bioregional network** for knowledge sharing, resource coordination, and mutual support
6. **Support bioregional exchange** of food, fiber, water, skills, tools, and services to reduce long-distance imports and associated emissions
7. **Develop the chapters model** so communities can adapt Permatours locally while staying connected
8. **Document and share learnings** as a replicable blueprint for other bioregions

### Funding Goal

**Raise $1M by the end of 2026** to continue the work, expand into the areas and approaches articulated above, and make grants to the community hubs Permatours serves. Revenue strategy includes grants, donations, fiscal sponsorship fees, skilled-labor contracting, event revenue, and tokenized marketplace activity.
