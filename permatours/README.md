> *Permaculture Action & Mutual Aid Network -- Northeast Bioregion of Turtle Island*

**Website:** [permatours.org](https://www.permatours.org/)
**Entity:** Nonprofit (501c3)
**Scale:** Northeast Bioregion
**Status:** Active -- evolving into decentralized mutual aid network

---

## Overview

Permatours is a Northeast-based permaculture action, education, and mutual aid network that activates people to learn by doing while strengthening land-based community hubs across the bioregion. Since 2021, Permatours has co-created **50+ learn-by-doing events** across **40+ land-based project sites**, building a network of 2,000 email subscribers and 1,000 active members.

Permatours is not a single place or program -- it is a **living network** that flows resources outward to the communities it serves, connecting permaculture practitioners, land projects, and aligned organizations through hands-on action: natural building workshops, food forest installations, herbal education, community festivals, skill-shares, and mutual aid coordination.

## Core Activities

- Natural building workshops (cob, hempcrete, earthen construction, tiny homes)
- Permaculture design and food forest installations
- Bioconstruction immersions (including international collaborations in Chiapas, Mexico)
- Plant walks, herbal wisdom circles, and medicinal cultivation
- Water systems creation and ecological restoration
- Community festivals, convergences, and ceremonial gatherings
- Skill-sharing, volunteer coordination, and mutual aid rapid response

## The Next Evolution

**1. Mutual Aid Network** -- Restructuring into distributed working circles (Event Production, Communications, Conflict Resolution, Grant Writing, Rapid Response, Education) with transparent governance via community assemblies and the Permatours Covenant.

**2. Regenerative Tokenomics** -- A dual-token system: Utility Tokens (community currency, 1 UT = $1 USD) and Voice Tokens (non-transferable governance tokens with seasonal decay). Economic and governance power intentionally separated; anti-speculation safeguards built in.

**3. Chapters Model** -- Replicable local chapters with shared infrastructure (fiscal sponsorship, volunteer database, coordination tools, educational resources). Three activation pathways: consulting, backend production, and co-hosted pilot events. Designed for bioregions worldwide.

## What Makes It Unique

- **Network model** -- distributed across the bioregion, not anchored to one location
- **Action-first** -- work days, builds, plantings, harvests, mutual aid
- **Mutual aid at the core** -- built on reciprocity, solidarity, and shared agreements
- **NE Hub system** -- local nodes self-organizing under shared values
- **Regenerative tokenomics** -- dual-token system preventing extraction and aligning incentives with participation
- **Built-in media engine** -- every tour documented for educational content and storytelling
- **Designed for replication** -- chapters model, tokenomics, and governance as blueprints for other bioregions

## Key People

- **Syd Harvey Griffith** -- Co-founder; built the network supporting 40+ land-based projects across the NE
- **Pato** -- Permaculture installations, global hub partnerships, nonprofit management
- **Scotty** -- Soil science, compost co-op, natural building, core educator

## Funding

**Goal:** $1M by end of 2026
**Sources:** Grants, donations, fiscal sponsorship fees, skilled-labor contracting, event revenue, tokenized marketplace activity

## Connection Points

- **Unified Sanctuaries** -- One hub among many in the NE network; runs projects and trainings there
- **Planetary Party** -- Network practitioners participate in PP gatherings; PP provides cultural infrastructure
- **Kinship Earth** -- KE has deployed flow funds so Permatours could flow resources outward to communities
- **NE Hubs** -- Distributed nodes coordinating through shared values
