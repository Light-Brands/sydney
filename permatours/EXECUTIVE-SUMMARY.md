# Permatours -- Executive Summary

## Overview

Based in the Northeast of Turtle Island, Permatours is a permaculture action, education, and mutual aid network that activates people to learn-by-doing, while increasing the capacity of land-based community hubs across the bioregion.

Co-founded Syd Harvey Griffith and Scotty Guzman, Permatours has co-created **50+ learn-by-doing events** across **40+ land-based project sites** since 2021, building a mycelial network of communities, organizers, educators, and volunteers dedicated to regenerating ecosystems, empowering local stewardship, and addressing essential needs: food, water, shelter, energy, and belonging.

Permatours is a **living network** -- a capacity-builder and mobilizer that attracts hands-on volunteer support to the communities it serves.

## The Next Evolution

Permatours is evolving from a small team of under-resourced organizers into a **decentralized mutual aid network** with five interconnected dimensions:

### 1. Mutual Aid Network

    style ED fill:#C8E6C9,stroke:#81C784,color:#000
    style ASM fill:#2E7D32,stroke:#1B5E20,color:#fff
```

Co-creating within distributed working groups, each operating under shared agreements (the Permatours Covenant) with transparent governance and community assemblies.

### 2. Regenerative Tokenomics

    end

    style REPUTATION fill:#F3E5F5,stroke:#CE93D8,color:#000

    style VT fill:#90CAF9,stroke:#42A5F5,color:#000
    style REP fill:#CE93D8,stroke:#AB47BC,color:#000
```

A dual-token system designed to recognize contributions, coordinate participation, and enable shared exchange -- without speculation or extraction. Economic power (UT), governance power (VT), and cultural reputation are intentionally separated to prevent concentration.

### 3. Chapters Model

The Chapters Model is a replicable framework that allows communities in other bioregions to launch their own locally-rooted Permatours chapters while staying connected to the broader network. Each chapter operates autonomously under shared agreements (the Permatours Covenant), with access to Permatours' 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship, volunteer coordination infrastructure, marketing tools, educational resources, and Discord-based communication. Chapters can be activated through consulting support, backend production assistance, or co-hosted pilot events -- enabling communities to adapt the model to their own land, people, and needs.

### 4. Paid Workshops and Festivals

Permatours plans to continue hosting paid events alongside its volunteer and mutual aid work, creating opportunities for its community of educators, practitioners, artists, and others to earn income for their contributions. Paid events serve as a revenue stream that supports the broader network while ensuring that skilled community members are fairly compensated. All paid events include work trade opportunities and scholarships to maintain accessibility and align with Permatours' commitment to inclusion and mutual aid.

### 5. Trade Circles

Permatours plans to increase opportunities for members of its community to trade goods and services at events. This practice is already common at the festivals Permatours has produced, and the goal is to make it a regular feature across all events -- supporting each other's livelihoods and creating a culture of direct exchange. Trade Circles also create opportunities for community members to use the utility tokens earned through participation in Permatours events, building toward a regenerative local economy rooted in reciprocity.

## Capital Strategy & Financial Targets

| Timeframe | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Near-term | **$200K** by end of 2026 |
| By end of 2027 | **$500K** raised |
| By 2030 | **$5M** raised |

### Revenue Strategy

Grants, donations, fiscal sponsorship fees, skilled-labor contracting, event revenue, and tokenized marketplace activity.

---

## Governance Structure

- **Community Assemblies** -- Transparent governance through collective decision-making
- **Working Circles** -- Six autonomous circles operating within shared agreements (the Permatours Covenant)
- **Consistent Event Rhythm** -- Regular programming and clear expectations and community upheld agreements maintains coherence and reduces the need for paid staff / centralized oversight
- **Clear Host Criteria** -- Standards for partner sites ensure quality and alignment
- **Dual-Token Governance** -- Voice Tokens (non-transferable, decaying) separate governance power from economic participation
- **Quest System** -- Any member can propose and complete valued work with peer verification

---

## Legal & Entity Structure

- **Entity Type:** Nonprofit (501c3)
- **Fiscal Sponsorship:** Provides 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship to aligned programs and to local chapters

## What Makes Permatours Unique

1. **Network model, not a single project** -- distributed across the bioregion rather than anchored to one location
2. **Action-first** -- work days, builds, plantings, harvests, mutual aid
3. **Mutual aid at the core** -- not transactional; built on reciprocity, solidarity, and shared agreements
4. **NE Hub system** -- local nodes that self-organize under shared values and coordination
5. **Regenerative tokenomics** (under development) -- a dual-token system that separates economic and governance power, prevents extraction, and aligns incentives with participation
6. **Built-in media engine** -- every tour and project is documented, creating ongoing educational content and storytelling
7. **Designed for replication** -- the chapters model (under development), tokenomics, and governance framework are blueprints for other bioregions

---

## Key Risks & Open Questions

- **Fundraising execution:** Achieving $200K by the end of 2026, $500K by the end of 2027, and $5M by 2030, requires grants, donations, and event revenue at a scale beyond current operations
- **Decentralization transition:** Moving from a founder-led small team to distributed working circles without losing coherence or momentum
- **Tokenomics implementation:** Designing, testing, and deploying a dual-token system that works in practice and gains community adoption
- **Chapter activation:** Building replicable chapters requires pilot testing, documentation, and volunteer point-people in new bioregions
- **Sustainability without burnout:** The network has been built by under-resourced organizers; scaling requires sustainable funding and distributed labor
- **Data and impact measurement:** Collecting rigorous impact data across 40+ distributed sites to unlock larger grants and credit markets

---

## Summary

Permatours has built a proven bioregional network with 50+ events across 45+ sites and a community of 2K+ active members, demonstrating that action-first, mutual-aid-centered permaculture education can mobilize people and strengthen land-based communities at scale. The next evolution -- into a decentralized mutual aid network with regenerative tokenomics and a replicable chapters model, plus more intensive data collection efforts -- positions Permatours to become both the bioregional implementation engine for the wider regenerative ecosystem and a blueprint that communities in any bioregion can adapt to meet their own needs.
