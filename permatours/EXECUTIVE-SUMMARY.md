# Permatours -- Executive Summary

## Overview

Permatours is a Northeast-based permaculture action, education, and mutual aid network that activates people to learn by doing while strengthening land-based community hubs across the bioregion. Founded and led by Syd Harvey Griffith, Permatours has co-created **50+ learn-by-doing events** across **40+ land-based project sites** since 2021, building a mycelial network of communities, organizers, educators, and volunteers dedicated to regenerating ecosystems, empowering local stewardship, and addressing essential needs: food, water, shelter, energy, and belonging.

Permatours is not a single place or a traditional nonprofit program. It is a **living network** -- a capacity-builder and mobilizer that flows resources outward to the communities it serves.

**Website:** [permatours.org](https://www.permatours.org/)
**Entity:** Nonprofit (501c3)
**Scale:** Northeast Bioregion of Turtle Island
**Status:** Active -- evolving into decentralized mutual aid network

---

## Mission & Vision

**Mission:** To support people in learning how to meet their basic needs in alignment with their values, with the support of community, land, and shared responsibility -- reducing dependency on extractive or misaligned systems and returning to ways of living that genuinely nourish people and place.

**Vision:** A bioregional network where people can rebuild practical life skills, experience community-supported living, reconnect with land-based relational ways of living, and transition from passive participation to active stewardship -- co-creating resilient alternatives rooted in place, season, and reciprocity.

## The Next Evolution

Permatours is evolving from a small team of under-resourced organizers into a **decentralized mutual aid network** with three interconnected dimensions:

### 1. Mutual Aid Network

    style EP fill:#C8E6C9,stroke:#81C784,color:#000
    style CS fill:#C8E6C9,stroke:#81C784,color:#000
    style CR fill:#C8E6C9,stroke:#81C784,color:#000

    style MA fill:#C8E6C9,stroke:#81C784,color:#000
    style ED fill:#C8E6C9,stroke:#81C784,color:#000
    style ASM fill:#2E7D32,stroke:#1B5E20,color:#fff
```

Restructuring into distributed working circles, each operating within shared agreements (the Permatours Covenant) with transparent governance via community assemblies.

### 2. Regenerative Tokenomics

```mermaid

        VT["VOICE TOKEN<br/>Non-transferable<br/>40 VT cap per person<br/>20% seasonal decay<br/>Voting on proposals<br/>Network decisions"]
    end

    style VT fill:#90CAF9,stroke:#42A5F5,color:#000
    style REP fill:#CE93D8,stroke:#AB47BC,color:#000
```

A dual-token system designed to recognize contributions, coordinate participation, and enable shared exchange -- without speculation or extraction. Economic power (UT), governance power (VT), and cultural reputation are intentionally separated to prevent concentration.

### 3. Chapters Model

    style CH4 fill:#E8F5E9,stroke:#C8E6C9,color:#000
    style PATHS fill:#E8F5E9,stroke:#81C784,color:#000
```

A replicable model so communities can adapt Permatours locally while staying connected to the broader network.

---

## Capital Strategy & Financial Targets

| Timeframe | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Near-term | **$1M** by end of 2026 |

### Revenue Strategy

Grants, donations, fiscal sponsorship fees, skilled-labor contracting, event revenue, and tokenized marketplace activity.

---

## Governance Structure

- **Community Assemblies** -- Transparent governance through collective decision-making
- **Working Circles** -- Six autonomous circles operating within shared agreements (the Permatours Covenant)
- **Consistent Event Rhythm** -- Regular programming maintains coherence without centralized control
- **Clear Host Criteria** -- Standards for partner sites ensure quality and alignment
- **Dual-Token Governance** -- Voice Tokens (non-transferable, decaying) separate governance power from economic participation
- **Six Core Circles** -- Builders, Weavers, Storytellers, Resource Stewards, Governance/Evolution, Care Stewards
- **Quest System** -- Any member can propose and complete valued work with peer verification

---

## Legal & Entity Structure

- **Entity Type:** Nonprofit (501c3)
- **Fiscal Sponsorship:** Provides 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship to local chapters
- **Relationship to Kinship Earth:** KE has deployed flow funds so Permatours could flow resources **outward** to community members and ecosystems -- not to fund its own internal operations
- **Design Principle:** Permatours flows resources outward to communities; Syd's other projects are not its primary beneficiaries

```

| Partner Entity | Relationship |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Unified Sanctuaries** | One hub among many in the NE network; runs projects and trainings on-site |
| **Planetary Party** | Bioregional implementation partner; network practitioners participate in PP gatherings; PP provides cultural infrastructure |
| **Kinship Earth** | KE has deployed flow funds so Permatours could flow resources outward to communities |
| **NE Hubs** | Distributed nodes coordinating through shared values -- 40+ partner sites |
| **Diggers Cooperative** | Connected through founding team; worker-owned composting and landscaping |

**Core principle:** Permatours flows resources **outward** to community members and ecosystems. It is a network, not a funnel -- designed to strengthen many hubs, not centralize around one.

---

## Founding Team

| Name | Role | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| **Syd Harvey Griffith** | Co-Founder | Built the network supporting 40+ land-based projects across the NE. Executive Director of Kinship Earth, co-founder of Permatours, lead designer of Planetary Party. The connective force weaving Permatours into the larger regenerative ecosystem. |
| **Pato** | Core Team | Permaculture installations, global hub partnerships, nonprofit management |
| **Scotty** | Core Team | Soil science, compost co-op, natural building -- core practitioner and educator |

---

## How to Get Involved

| Pathway | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Volunteer** | Join an event or contribute remotely |
| **Host an Event** | Open your community center, farm, or land project |
| **Donate** | Support the network and the hubs it serves |
| **Educate** | Teach at an event -- in person or online |
| **Build the Chapters Model** | Activate Permatours in your bioregion |
| **Develop Tokenomics** | Help design and test regenerative economic systems |
| **Build the Mutual Aid Network** | Contribute to governance, circle work, and collective stewardship |

---

## What Makes Permatours Unique

1. **Network model, not a single project** -- distributed across the bioregion rather than anchored to one location
2. **Action-first** -- work days, builds, plantings, harvests, mutual aid
3. **Mutual aid at the core** -- not transactional; built on reciprocity, solidarity, and shared agreements
4. **NE Hub system** -- local nodes that self-organize under shared values and coordination
5. **Regenerative tokenomics** -- a dual-token system that separates economic and governance power, prevents extraction, and aligns incentives with participation
6. **Built-in media engine** -- every tour and project is documented, creating ongoing educational content and storytelling
7. **Designed for replication** -- the chapters model, tokenomics, and governance framework are blueprints for other bioregions
8. **Outward resource flow** -- designed to strengthen communities, not to funnel energy inward

---

## Key Risks & Open Questions

- **Fundraising execution:** Achieving $1M by end of 2026 requires grants, donations, and event revenue at a scale beyond current operations
- **Decentralization transition:** Moving from a founder-led small team to distributed working circles without losing coherence or momentum
- **Tokenomics implementation:** Designing, testing, and deploying a dual-token system that works in practice and gains community adoption
- **Chapter activation:** Building replicable chapters requires pilot testing, documentation, and volunteer point-people in new bioregions
- **Sustainability without burnout:** The network has been built by under-resourced organizers; scaling requires sustainable funding and distributed labor
- **Data and impact measurement:** Collecting rigorous impact data across 40+ distributed sites to unlock larger grants and credit markets

---

## Summary

Permatours has built a proven bioregional network with 50+ events across 40+ sites and a community of 1,000+ active members, demonstrating that action-first, mutual-aid-centered permaculture education can mobilize people and strengthen land-based communities at scale. The next evolution -- into a decentralized mutual aid network with regenerative tokenomics and a replicable chapters model -- positions Permatours to become both the bioregional implementation engine for the wider regenerative ecosystem and a blueprint that communities in any bioregion can adapt to meet their own needs.
