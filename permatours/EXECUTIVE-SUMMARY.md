# Permatours -- Executive Summary

**Permaculture Action & Mutual Aid Network -- Northeast Bioregion of Turtle Island**

*Prepared: February 2026*

---

## Overview

Permatours is a Northeast-based permaculture action, education, and mutual aid network that activates people to learn by doing while strengthening land-based community hubs across the bioregion. Founded and led by Syd Harvey Griffith, Permatours has co-created **50+ learn-by-doing events** across **40+ land-based project sites** since 2021, building a mycelial network of communities, organizers, educators, and volunteers dedicated to regenerating ecosystems, empowering local stewardship, and addressing essential needs: food, water, shelter, energy, and belonging.

Permatours is not a single place or a traditional nonprofit program. It is a **living network** -- a capacity-builder and mobilizer that flows resources outward to the communities it serves. It connects permaculture practitioners, land projects, and aligned organizations through hands-on action: natural building workshops, food forest installations, herbal education, community festivals, skill-shares, and mutual aid coordination. Every event is documented, creating an ongoing body of educational media and storytelling that amplifies impact and inspires replication.

## The Core Purpose

To support people in learning how to meet their basic needs in alignment with their values, with the support of community, land, and shared responsibility -- reducing dependency on extractive or misaligned systems and returning to ways of living that genuinely nourish people and place.

Permatours exists to help people:

- **Rebuild practical life skills** -- food production, natural building, care, energy systems, collaboration
- **Experience community-supported living** -- what it means to be held by a network instead of dependent on institutions
- **Reconnect with land-based, relational ways of living** -- rooted in place, season, and reciprocity
- **Transition from passive participation to active stewardship** -- moving from consuming within broken systems toward co-creating resilient alternatives

This is not about isolation or rejection of society. It is about **choice, resilience, and dignity** -- remembering how to care for ourselves and one another in ways that feel whole.

## Track Record (2021-2025)

Over four years, Permatours has cultivated a bioregional network spanning New England and the broader Northeast, partnering with regenerative projects including Sacred Nectar Sanctuary (NH), Diggers Co-Op (ME), Rooted Heart Farm (ME), Wild Island Center (ME), Blackbirds Daughter Botanicals (NH), Orange Peel Bakery (Martha's Vineyard, MA), and dozens of community land trusts, urban farms, and homesteads.

**Programming delivered:**
- Natural building workshops (cob ovens, hempcrete structures, A-frame tiny homes, earthen construction)
- Permaculture design and food forest installations
- Bioconstruction immersions (including international collaborations in Chiapas, Mexico)
- Hemp building and fiber systems workshops
- Plant walks, herbal wisdom circles, and medicinal cultivation
- Water systems creation and ecological restoration
- Community festivals, convergences, and ceremonial gatherings
- The Northeast Eco Communities Convergence
- Skill-sharing, volunteer coordination, and mutual aid rapid response

**Network scale:** 2,000 email subscribers, 1,000 active members, proven model for mobilizing volunteers, coordinating land-based projects, and co-creating educational experiences that build real capacity.

## The Next Evolution

Permatours is evolving from a small team of under-resourced organizers into a **decentralized mutual aid network** -- one where the work is held and stewarded by the collective, not dependent on paid staff. This evolution has three interconnected dimensions:

### 1. Mutual Aid Network

Restructuring into a distributed network of autonomous working circles:

- **Event Production & Logistics** -- co-creating the hands-on events that are Permatours' heartbeat
- **Communications & Storytelling** -- documenting impact and amplifying partner communities
- **Conflict Resolution & Care** -- trained mediators, accountability processes, community repair
- **Grant Writing & Resource Mobilization** -- unlocking funding and flowing it to community hubs
- **Mutual Aid & Rapid Response** -- pre-vetted volunteers, shared asset maps, emergency coordination for climate and social crises
- **Education & Skill-Sharing** -- curriculum development, educator coordination, knowledge exchange

Each circle operates within shared agreements (the Permatours Covenant) while self-organizing around its purpose. A consistent event rhythm, transparent governance via community assemblies, and clear host criteria ensure coherence without centralized control.

### 2. Regenerative Tokenomics

A dual-token system designed to recognize contributions, coordinate participation, and enable shared exchange -- without speculation or extraction:

**Utility Tokens (UT)** -- Community currency (1 UT = $1 USD, non-liquid) for marketplace trades, workshop access, skill exchanges, and mutual aid. Immediately earnable and spendable by anyone through verified labor: event participation, teaching, care work, remote contributions, and circle-defined tasks.

**Voice Tokens (VT)** -- Non-transferable governance tokens representing trust, consistency, and active participation. Used for voting on proposals and network decisions. Earnable only by Members (3+ events attended, 3 vouches from existing members). Capped at 40 VT per person with 20% seasonal decay -- ensuring governance power reflects current participation, not historical accumulation.

**Key design principles:**
- Economic power (UT), governance power (VT), and cultural reputation are intentionally separated to prevent concentration
- Anti-speculation safeguards: UT cannot convert to cash; VT cannot be traded; transfer limits prevent wealth hoarding
- Seasonal assemblies review supply, marketplace health, and rotate roles
- A Commons Treasury funded by voluntary contributions, event fees, and marketplace transactions supports shared needs
- Six core circles (Builders, Weavers, Storytellers, Resource Stewards, Governance/Evolution, Care Stewards) provide organizational structure
- A quest system enables any member to propose and complete valued work with peer verification

This model is designed to be **expandable as a Northeast bioregional token** and adaptable as a blueprint for other bioregions.

### 3. Chapters Model

A replicable chapters model so communities can adapt the Permatours approach locally while staying connected to the broader network:

- **Local chapters** activated by volunteer point-people who steward day-to-day logistics in their bioregion
- **Shared infrastructure** -- access to Permatours' 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship, volunteer database, Discord coordination, marketing tools, and educational resources
- **Three activation pathways**: consulting support for existing projects, backend production assistance for events, and co-hosted pilot events that seed new chapters
- **Hub criteria** -- partner sites provide access to affordable housing or stays, offer healthy food, host educational or community-centered gatherings, demonstrate regenerative practices, and serve community benefit
- **Global applicability** -- while currently Northeast-focused, designed to serve bioregions worldwide

## Project Plan

1. **Support hands-on, land-based learning** that helps people meet basic needs in alignment with their values
2. **Strengthen community-led mutual aid** -- distributing leadership and reducing reliance on extractive systems
3. **Deploy regenerative tokenomics** to recognize contributions, coordinate participation, and support shared exchange without speculation
4. **Collect and share impact data** with partner communities to unlock larger grant opportunities and access carbon and biodiversity credit markets
5. **Build a Northeast bioregional network** for knowledge sharing, resource coordination, and mutual support
6. **Support bioregional exchange** of food, fiber, water, skills, tools, and services to reduce long-distance imports and emissions
7. **Develop the chapters model** so communities can adapt Permatours locally while staying connected
8. **Document and share learnings** as a replicable blueprint for other bioregions

---

## Funding

**Goal:** Raise $1M by the end of 2026 to continue the work, expand into the areas and approaches articulated above, and make grants to the community hubs Permatours serves.

**Revenue strategy:** Grants, donations, fiscal sponsorship fees, skilled-labor contracting, event revenue, and tokenized marketplace activity.

## What Makes Permatours Unique

- **Network model, not a single project** -- distributed across the bioregion rather than anchored to one location
- **Action-first** -- work days, builds, plantings, harvests, mutual aid
- **Mutual aid at the core** -- not transactional; built on reciprocity, solidarity, and shared agreements
- **NE Hub system** -- local nodes that self-organize under shared values and coordination
- **Regenerative tokenomics** -- a dual-token system that separates economic and governance power, prevents extraction, and aligns incentives with participation
- **Built-in media engine** -- every tour and project is documented, creating ongoing educational content and storytelling
- **Designed for replication** -- the chapters model, tokenomics, and governance framework are blueprints for other bioregions

## Ecosystem Context

Permatours sits within a constellation of four interconnected initiatives at different scales:

| Initiative | Role | Scale |
|------------|------|-------|
| **Kinship Earth** | Flow Funding & Regenerative Capital | Global |
| **Planetary Party** | Cultural & Coordination Protocol | Global |
| **Permatours** | Permaculture Action & Mutual Aid | Northeast Bioregion |
| **Unified Sanctuaries** | Land-Based Regenerative Village | Local (Southern Vermont) |

Permatours flows resources **outward** to community members and ecosystems. Syd's other projects are not its primary beneficiaries.
