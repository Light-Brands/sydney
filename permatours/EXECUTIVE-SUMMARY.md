# Permatours -- Executive Summary

## Overview

Permatours is a Northeast-based permaculture action, education, and mutual aid network that activates people to learn by doing while strengthening land-based community hubs across the bioregion. Founded and led by Syd Harvey Griffith, Permatours has co-created **50+ learn-by-doing events** across **40+ land-based project sites** since 2021, building a mycelial network of communities, organizers, educators, and volunteers dedicated to regenerating ecosystems, empowering local stewardship, and addressing essential needs: food, water, shelter, energy, and belonging.

Permatours is not a single place or a traditional nonprofit program. It is a **living network** -- a capacity-builder and mobilizer that flows resources outward to the communities it serves.

## The Core Model: Permaculture Action Network

Permatours connects permaculture practitioners, land projects, and aligned organizations through hands-on action: natural building workshops, food forest installations, herbal education, community festivals, skill-shares, and mutual aid coordination. Every event is documented, creating an ongoing body of educational media and storytelling that amplifies impact and inspires replication.

### Programming Delivered (2021-2025)

- Natural building workshops (cob ovens, hempcrete structures, A-frame tiny homes, earthen construction)
- Permaculture design and food forest installations
- Bioconstruction immersions (including international collaborations in Chiapas, Mexico)
- Hemp building and fiber systems workshops
- Plant walks, herbal wisdom circles, and medicinal cultivation
- Water systems creation and ecological restoration
- Community festivals, convergences, and ceremonial gatherings
- The Northeast Eco Communities Convergence
- Skill-sharing, volunteer coordination, and mutual aid rapid response

### Partner Network

40+ partner sites including Sacred Nectar Sanctuary (NH), Diggers Co-Op (ME), Rooted Heart Farm (ME), Wild Island Center (ME), Blackbirds Daughter Botanicals (NH), Orange Peel Bakery (Martha's Vineyard, MA), and dozens of community land trusts, urban farms, and homesteads.

### Network Scale

2,000 email subscribers, 1,000 active members -- proven model for mobilizing volunteers, coordinating land-based projects, and co-creating educational experiences that build real capacity.

---

## The Next Evolution

Permatours is evolving from a small team of under-resourced organizers into a **decentralized mutual aid network** with three interconnected dimensions:

### 1. Mutual Aid Network

Restructuring into distributed working circles:

- **Event Production & Logistics** -- co-creating hands-on events
- **Communications & Storytelling** -- documenting impact and amplifying partner communities
- **Conflict Resolution & Care** -- trained mediators, accountability processes, community repair
- **Grant Writing & Resource Mobilization** -- unlocking funding and flowing it to community hubs
- **Mutual Aid & Rapid Response** -- pre-vetted volunteers, shared asset maps, emergency coordination
- **Education & Skill-Sharing** -- curriculum development, educator coordination, knowledge exchange

Each circle operates within shared agreements (the Permatours Covenant) with transparent governance via community assemblies.

### 2. Regenerative Tokenomics

A dual-token system designed to recognize contributions, coordinate participation, and enable shared exchange -- without speculation or extraction:

**Utility Tokens (UT)** -- Community currency (1 UT = $1 USD, non-liquid) for marketplace trades, workshop access, skill exchanges, and mutual aid. Immediately earnable and spendable by anyone through verified labor.

**Voice Tokens (VT)** -- Non-transferable governance tokens representing trust, consistency, and active participation. Used for voting on proposals and network decisions. Capped at 40 VT per person with 20% seasonal decay -- ensuring governance power reflects current participation, not historical accumulation.

**Key design principles:**
- Economic power (UT), governance power (VT), and cultural reputation are intentionally separated
- Anti-speculation safeguards: UT cannot convert to cash; VT cannot be traded; transfer limits prevent wealth hoarding
- Seasonal assemblies review supply, marketplace health, and rotate roles
- Designed to be expandable as a Northeast bioregional token and adaptable for other bioregions

### 3. Chapters Model

A replicable model so communities can adapt Permatours locally while staying connected:

- **Local chapters** activated by volunteer point-people in their bioregion
- **Shared infrastructure** -- 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship, volunteer database, Discord coordination, marketing tools, educational resources
- **Three activation pathways:** consulting, backend production, and co-hosted pilot events
- **Hub criteria** -- partner sites provide affordable housing/stays, healthy food, educational gatherings, regenerative practices, and community benefit
- **Global applicability** -- while currently Northeast-focused, designed to serve bioregions worldwide

---

## Capital Strategy & Financial Targets

| Timeframe | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Near-term | **$1M** by end of 2026 |

### Revenue Strategy

Grants, donations, fiscal sponsorship fees, skilled-labor contracting, event revenue, and tokenized marketplace activity.

---

## Governance Structure

- **Community Assemblies** -- Transparent governance through collective decision-making
- **Working Circles** -- Six autonomous circles operating within shared agreements (the Permatours Covenant)
- **Consistent Event Rhythm** -- Regular programming maintains coherence without centralized control
- **Clear Host Criteria** -- Standards for partner sites ensure quality and alignment
- **Dual-Token Governance** -- Voice Tokens (non-transferable, decaying) separate governance power from economic participation
- **Six Core Circles** -- Builders, Weavers, Storytellers, Resource Stewards, Governance/Evolution, Care Stewards
- **Quest System** -- Any member can propose and complete valued work with peer verification

---

## Legal & Entity Structure

- **Entity Type:** Nonprofit (501c3)
- **Fiscal Sponsorship:** Provides 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship to local chapters
- **Relationship to Kinship Earth:** KE has deployed flow funds so Permatours could flow resources **outward** to community members and ecosystems -- not to fund its own internal operations
- **Design Principle:** Permatours flows resources outward to communities; Syd's other projects are not its primary beneficiaries

---

## Development Phases

### Phase 1 -- Strengthen & Restructure
- Continue hands-on, land-based learning events across the NE bioregion
- Restructure into distributed working circles (Mutual Aid Network)
- Formalize the Permatours Covenant and community assemblies
- Strengthen partnerships with 40+ existing hub sites

### Phase 2 -- Deploy & Scale
- Launch the dual-token regenerative tokenomics system (UT + VT)
- Activate the chapters model with pilot chapters
- Collect and share impact data with partner communities to unlock larger grants
- Support bioregional exchange of food, fiber, water, skills, tools, and services

### Phase 3 -- Blueprint & Replicate
- Document all learnings -- governance, tokenomics, chapters model, mutual aid processes
- Publish replicable blueprints for other bioregions
- Expand chapters model beyond the Northeast
- Serve as bioregional implementation partner for the Planetary Party Protocol

## Ecosystem & Strategic Partnerships

| Partner Entity | Relationship |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Unified Sanctuaries** | One hub among many in the NE network; runs projects and trainings on-site |
| **Planetary Party** | Bioregional implementation partner; network practitioners participate in PP gatherings; PP provides cultural infrastructure |
| **Kinship Earth** | KE has deployed flow funds so Permatours could flow resources outward to communities |
| **NE Hubs** | Distributed nodes coordinating through shared values -- 40+ partner sites |
| **Diggers Cooperative** | Connected through founding team; worker-owned composting and landscaping |

**Core principle:** Permatours flows resources **outward** to community members and ecosystems. It is a network, not a funnel -- designed to strengthen many hubs, not centralize around one.

---

## What Makes Permatours Unique

1. **Network model, not a single project** -- distributed across the bioregion rather than anchored to one location
2. **Action-first** -- work days, builds, plantings, harvests, mutual aid
3. **Mutual aid at the core** -- not transactional; built on reciprocity, solidarity, and shared agreements
4. **NE Hub system** -- local nodes that self-organize under shared values and coordination
5. **Regenerative tokenomics** -- a dual-token system that separates economic and governance power, prevents extraction, and aligns incentives with participation
6. **Built-in media engine** -- every tour and project is documented, creating ongoing educational content and storytelling
7. **Designed for replication** -- the chapters model, tokenomics, and governance framework are blueprints for other bioregions
8. **Outward resource flow** -- designed to strengthen communities, not to funnel energy inward

---

## Key Risks & Open Questions

- **Fundraising execution:** Achieving $1M by end of 2026 requires grants, donations, and event revenue at a scale beyond current operations
- **Decentralization transition:** Moving from a founder-led small team to distributed working circles without losing coherence or momentum
- **Tokenomics implementation:** Designing, testing, and deploying a dual-token system that works in practice and gains community adoption
- **Chapter activation:** Building replicable chapters requires pilot testing, documentation, and volunteer point-people in new bioregions
- **Sustainability without burnout:** The network has been built by under-resourced organizers; scaling requires sustainable funding and distributed labor
- **Data and impact measurement:** Collecting rigorous impact data across 40+ distributed sites to unlock larger grants and credit markets

---

## Summary

Permatours has built a proven bioregional network with 50+ events across 40+ sites and a community of 1,000+ active members, demonstrating that action-first, mutual-aid-centered permaculture education can mobilize people and strengthen land-based communities at scale. The next evolution -- into a decentralized mutual aid network with regenerative tokenomics and a replicable chapters model -- positions Permatours to become both the bioregional implementation engine for the wider regenerative ecosystem and a blueprint that communities in any bioregion can adapt to meet their own needs.
