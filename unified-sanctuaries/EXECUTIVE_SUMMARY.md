# Unified Sanctuaries — Executive Summary

## Overview

Unified Sanctuaries is a land-based regenerative community planned for Southern Vermont (Brattleboro / Guilford / Putney corridor) that integrates permaculture farming, healing arts, cultural programming, and cooperative living into a single, self-sustaining village. Conceived as a living laboratory for regenerative development, the project operates at the intersection of ecological stewardship, community economics, and cultural innovation. It is designed from the ground up as an open-source blueprint — every governance framework, financial model, and operational design will be publicly shared so that communities worldwide can adapt and replicate the model.

## Mission & Vision

**Mission:** To establish a thriving, multi-pillar sanctuary that regenerates land, culture, and livelihoods; hosts aligned businesses, residents, and gatherings; and demonstrates a viable alternative to extractive real estate development.

**Vision:** Unified Sanctuaries is an experimental hub for learning — a living lab and museum exploring healing approaches through permaculture, healing arts, community living, and education. It aims to serve as a regenerative model of village-scale living rooted in equity, Indigenous wisdom, and ecological stewardship — and to catalyze a global network of similar sanctuaries.

## The Four Pillars

The community is organized around four interdependent platforms, each operating with internal autonomy while sharing infrastructure, governance, and economic systems.

### 1. Permaculture Farm & Education Center
Regenerative agriculture, food sovereignty, a community cafe, forest school programming, and hands-on education. This pillar anchors the land ethic of the project and provides the nutritional and educational foundation for residents and visitors alike.

**Annual Revenue Potential:** $315K – $1M+

### 2. Retreat & Healing Arts Center + Bathhouse
Immersive retreats, somatic therapy, art therapy, herbalism, healing arts, a spa/bathhouse, and a makerspace for crafts and design. This pillar serves as the restoration and wellness engine of the community, drawing visitors and retreat participants year-round.

**Annual Revenue Potential:** $570K – $1.75M

### 3. Event Venue + Innovation Hall
Festivals, concerts, weddings, markets, conferences, knowledge-sharing gatherings, and AV/multimedia production. This pillar positions the sanctuary as a cultural and economic hub, generating revenue and visibility while providing programming infrastructure for the broader movement.

**Annual Revenue Potential:** $310K – $1.16M

### 4. Community Living / Regenerative Neighborhood
Eco-homes, tiny dwellings, shared stewardship, and cooperative living for 20+ households. Residents contribute to and benefit from the sanctuary's circular economy, forming the stable social fabric that sustains all other pillars.

**Annual Revenue Potential:** $195K – $580K

### Combined Revenue Potential: $1.4M – $4.5M+ annually (at maturity)

## Capital Strategy & Financial Targets

| Milestone | Target | Timeline |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Seed / Phase 1 Capital Raise | $10,000,000 | End of 2026 |
| Growth / Phase 2+ Capital Raise | $100,000,000 | 2028 |

Capital sources include philanthropic donations, impact investment, earned revenue, community memberships, and aligned partnerships. The project is actively engaging donors and impact investors during the current pre-acquisition phase.

---

## Economic Model

Unified Sanctuaries employs a circular internal economy designed to keep value local and reward contribution over capital:

- **Sol Token (Utility):** A community currency exchangeable for goods and services within the ecosystem — food, retreat sessions, event access, housing credits, and more.
- **Voice Token (Governance):** Earned through participation and stewardship, granting decision-making weight in community governance. Contribution, not just capital, determines influence.
- **Trust Units:** Earned through infrastructure development and improvements to the land. Trust units can be liquidated upon exit, ensuring that contributors build tangible equity through their work.
- **Non-Speculative Land Stewardship:** Land is held in trust (Sol Community Land Project), removing it from market speculation and ensuring permanent community stewardship.

Each pillar autonomously structures its own compensation and contribution-reward mechanisms while participating in the shared economic infrastructure.

---

## Governance Structure

Unified Sanctuaries blends **sociocracy** and **holacracy** principles into a consent-based, rotating governance model:

- **Anchor Circle (Council):** The central governance body that guides interconnected autonomous platforms, maintains shared infrastructure, upholds core values, and stewards the economic systems.
- **Autonomous Nodes:** Each of the four pillars operates as a self-governing unit with its own internal decision-making, compensation structures, and operational authority — while remaining accountable to the shared governance framework.
- **Consent-Based Decision-Making:** Decisions are made through consent rather than consensus or majority rule, ensuring that no one is overruled while maintaining operational agility.
- **Rotating Leadership:** Governance roles rotate to distribute power and develop leadership capacity across the community.

---

## Legal & Entity Structure

- **Sol Community Land Project:** The land trust vehicle that holds the property outside of market speculation.
- **Entity Structuring:** Community Land Trust (CLT) status is in progress. The relationship between the trust and operational LLCs is being formalized.
- **Open Questions:** How Kinship Earth funding flows into US operations (through the trust vs. directly to LLCs) is still being resolved to manage potential conflicts of interest.

---

## Development Phases

### Phase 1 — Land & Foundation
- Identify and secure the right property in Southern Vermont
- Establish legal, governance, and stewardship structures
- Invite early members and anchor contributors
- Refine governance frameworks and community agreements
- Engage donors and impact investors for the initial $10M raise

### Phase 2 — Build & Activate
- Develop core infrastructure: housing (20+ eco-homes), farm systems, gathering spaces, bathhouse, retreat facilities, and event venue
- Onboard residents and mission-aligned businesses
- Host retreats, residencies, activations, festivals, and educational programming
- Launch the circular economy (Sol Token, Voice Token, Trust Units)
- Scale revenue across all four pillars

### Phase 3 — Blueprint & Network
- Document all learnings — governance models, financial systems, construction methods, community processes
- Publish the open-source blueprint for global replication
- Support the emergence of additional sanctuaries in other bioregions
- Serve as a hub within larger bioregional and global regenerative ecosystems

## Ecosystem & Strategic Partnerships

Unified Sanctuaries is one node in a broader ecosystem of regenerative projects led by the founding team:

| Partner Entity | Relationship |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Kinship Earth** | Regenerative finance foundation; may point to US as a case study. Direct funding relationship is an open question due to shared leadership. |
| **Permatours** | Permaculture education nonprofit; US is one hub among many in the NE network. Could host Permatours projects and trainings on-site. |
| **Planetary Party** | Cultural gathering series; US could serve as one venue among many for PP events. PP serves many ecosystems independently. |
| **Diggers Cooperative** | Worker-owned composting and landscaping business connected to the founding team's expertise. |

**Important framing:** Unified Sanctuaries is positioned as "a node, not the trunk" — one expression among many in this ecosystem. It is a place where multiple streams can intersect, but it is not designed to be the central entity that everything flows into or out of.

## Key Risks & Open Questions

- **Land Acquisition:** The right property has not yet been secured. Location, price, zoning, and condition will significantly shape timelines and costs.
- **Capital Raise Execution:** Achieving $10M by end of 2026 and $100M by 2028 requires aggressive fundraising across philanthropy and impact investment.
- **Entity Structuring:** CLT status, LLC relationships, and funding flow from Kinship Earth are still being formalized.
- **Pre-Land Momentum:** Maintaining community energy and investor confidence during an acquisition phase with no physical site requires creative interim programming.
- **Governance at Scale:** Moving from a founding team to a full community with consent-based governance will require careful onboarding and conflict resolution systems.
- **Regulatory & Zoning:** Vermont land use, housing, and agricultural regulations will shape what can be built and how quickly.

## Summary

Unified Sanctuaries represents an ambitious and deeply considered approach to regenerative community development. With a proven founding team, a multi-pillar revenue model projecting $1.4M–$4.5M+ at maturity, a circular economy designed to keep value local, and a governance structure that distributes power through contribution rather than capital, the project is positioned to become both a thriving community and a replicable blueprint for regenerative villages worldwide. The immediate priorities are securing land in Southern Vermont, closing the Phase 1 capital raise of $10M, and building the founding community — while documenting every step for the communities that will follow.
