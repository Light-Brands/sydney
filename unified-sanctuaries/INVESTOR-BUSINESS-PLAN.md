# Unified Sanctuaries -- Investor Business Plan

**A Regenerative Village on University Infrastructure**

*Prepared February 2026 | Confidential*

---

## The Opportunity: A University Campus Becomes a Living Village

Across the country, small universities and college campuses are closing or consolidating -- leaving behind extraordinary infrastructure: dining halls, dormitories, classrooms, performance spaces, agricultural land, gathering halls, workshops, and utilities already built to code. These properties represent tens of millions of dollars in existing infrastructure that would cost multiples to build from scratch.

Unified Sanctuaries is positioned to acquire one of these campuses and transform it into a self-sustaining regenerative village -- a place where farming, healing, education, cultural gathering, and cooperative living operate as one integrated community. Not a commune. Not a resort. A functioning village economy with multiple revenue streams, a proven team, and a replicable model designed to be shared openly with the world.

**For an investor who understands land, knows the value of community, and has watched institutions fail the people they were built to serve -- this is a chance to repurpose that infrastructure for what it should have been all along: a place where people learn to grow food, heal, build together, and take care of each other.**

### Why University Infrastructure

A campus provides what would otherwise take years and millions to develop:

| Campus Asset | Village Function | Revenue Pillar |
|---|---|---|
| Agricultural land, greenhouses, barns | Regenerative farm, food forest, farm stand, cafe | **Permaculture Farm & Education** |
| Student housing, residential halls | Eco-homes, cooperative living for 20+ households | **Community Living** |
| Auditoriums, gyms, outdoor amphitheaters | Festivals, concerts, weddings, conferences, markets | **Event Venue & Innovation Hall** |
| Classrooms, studios, wellness facilities | Retreat center, healing arts, bathhouse, makerspace | **Retreat & Healing Arts Center** |
| Commercial kitchens, dining halls | Community cafe, catering, herbal apothecary | Shared across all pillars |
| Utilities, roads, water/sewer | Fully operational from day one | Foundation for all operations |

**The result: instead of a 5-year buildout, we can be revenue-generating within months of acquisition.** Infrastructure that a university spent decades building can be reactivated for a community that will actually use every square foot of it.

### Four Revenue Pillars -- $1.4M to $4.5M+ Annually at Maturity

**1. Permaculture Farm & Education Center** -- $315K to $1M+/year
Regenerative agriculture, a community cafe, forest school programming, agritourism (U-pick, farm dinners, workshops), and a farm stand. This is the heart of the land ethic -- growing food, teaching people how to grow food, and building food sovereignty for the region. Our team has hands-on experience managing farm operations, soil science, compost systems, herbalism, and permaculture design across 40+ land-based projects.

**2. Retreat & Healing Arts Center + Bathhouse** -- $570K to $1.75M/year
Immersive retreats, somatic therapy, art therapy, herbalism, a spa and bathhouse, a campground, and a makerspace. Campus wellness facilities, studios, and residential halls convert directly into retreat infrastructure. Our team includes practitioners in somatic therapy, herbalism, ritual theater, visual and performing arts, consent-based facilitation, and ecstatic movement.

**3. Event Venue & Innovation Hall** -- $310K to $1.16M/year
Festivals, concerts, weddings, conferences, knowledge-sharing gatherings, and AV/multimedia production. Campus auditoriums, outdoor spaces, and dining facilities are already built for large gatherings. Our team has direct experience in festival production, event logistics, financial operations, and multimedia production at scale.

**4. Community Living / Regenerative Neighborhood** -- $195K to $580K/year
Cooperative living for 20+ households in converted campus housing and new eco-builds. Residents contribute to the village economy and form the stable social fabric that sustains all other pillars. Revenue from housing fees, membership dues, and shared stewardship contributions.

### The Team -- Proven, Ready, and Already Working Together

This is not a group of strangers with a business plan. This is a team that has been building together for years -- across 50+ learn-by-doing events, 40+ land-based project sites, and a network of 2,200+ participants. We have raised over $800,000 through our nonprofit Kinship Earth and deployed $370,000+ in direct grants to grassroots leaders across 12+ bioregions. We are already operating.

## Page 3: Execution Plan, Financial Model, and the Ask

### Upon Acquisition: The 90-Day Activation

This is not a "build it someday" plan. Upon campus acquisition, the team executes immediately:

**Days 1-30: Foundation**
- Founding team moves on-site; key personnel occupy campus housing
- Legal structures finalized (Community Land Trust, pillar-specific trusts, stewardship agreements)
- Farm assessment: soil testing, existing agricultural infrastructure inventory, first-season crop planning
- Building audit: which campus facilities map to which pillar, what needs renovation vs. immediate activation
- Early membership and community engagement launch

**Days 31-60: First Revenue**
- Farm stand and community cafe open (using campus commercial kitchen and existing agricultural land)
- First retreat and workshop programming scheduled (using campus studios, residential halls, wellness spaces)
- Event venue bookings begin (weddings, conferences, festivals -- campus auditoriums and outdoor spaces)
- Permatours activates volunteer network for initial work days, builds, and plantings on-site

**Days 61-90: Community Formation**
- First residents onboarded into cooperative living (converted campus housing)
- Governance structures activated (Anchor Circle, pillar-specific autonomous nodes, community agreements)
- Circular economy infrastructure launched (community utility token, voice governance tokens)
- Public storytelling and media production begins -- documenting the transformation for fundraising and replication

### Financial Summary

| | Year 1 (Conservative) | Year 2 | Year 3 (At Maturity) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Farm & Education** | $315K | $600K | $1M+ |
| **Retreat & Healing Arts** | $570K | $1M | $1.75M |
| **Event Venue** | $310K | $700K | $1.16M |
| **Community Living** | $195K | $400K | $580K |
| **Total Revenue** | **$1.4M** | **$2.7M** | **$4.5M+** |

Revenue is diversified across four independent pillars. No single pillar carries the model -- if one has a slow season, three others continue generating. This is the resilience of a village economy versus a single-purpose business.

### Capital Strategy

| Phase | Target | Timeline | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | **$10M** | End of 2026 | Campus acquisition, legal structuring, initial activation, first-year operations |
| **Phase 2** | **$100M** | 2028 | Full buildout, eco-home construction, expanded programming, infrastructure upgrades, open-source documentation |

Capital sources: impact investment, philanthropic donations, community memberships, earned revenue, aligned partnerships, and government grants (USDA Beginning Farmer, Vermont Housing & Conservation Board, climate programs).

### What Makes This Investment Different

**1. Existing Infrastructure Eliminates the Biggest Risk.** The #1 reason land-based community projects fail is the multi-year, multi-million-dollar buildout before any revenue flows. A university campus removes that barrier. We inherit decades of investment in buildings, utilities, and land -- and activate them for their highest purpose.

**2. The Team is Already Operating.** This is not a first-time founder with a pitch deck. This is a team with years of shared work, $800K+ raised and deployed through established nonprofits, 50+ events produced, 40+ land projects served, and a living network of 2,200+ practitioners ready to show up. We are not asking for money to figure it out. We are asking for the asset so we can do what we already know how to do -- at scale.

**3. Non-Speculative Land Stewardship.** The land goes into a Community Land Trust -- permanently removed from market speculation. This is not a real estate play. This is a regenerative investment in a community asset that grows in value through stewardship, not extraction. For an investor who cares about legacy, this means the land serves people and ecology forever, not just until the next sale.

**4. Community is the Product.** Every pillar is designed around gathering people: farmers growing food together, healers practicing together, artists creating together, neighbors living together. Revenue comes from the natural activity of a thriving community -- not from artificial demand or marketing gimmicks. For someone who loves building community, this is community as the entire business model.

**5. Open-Source Blueprint.** Every governance framework, financial model, and operational design will be documented and shared publicly. This is not just one village -- it is the template for hundreds. Your investment doesn't end at one property line. It seeds a movement.

### The Ask

We are seeking an aligned investor-partner to acquire a university campus in the Southern Vermont corridor (Brattleboro / Guilford / Putney) -- or a comparable campus property with the right infrastructure -- and place it into a Community Land Trust as the permanent home of Unified Sanctuaries.

This is an invitation for someone who:
- Understands that the best infrastructure in America is sitting empty while communities go without
- Knows from experience that farming is both a livelihood and a way of life worth protecting
- Believes that helping people and building community is not just good ethics -- it is good economics
- Wants their capital to create something that outlasts them

**We have the team. We have the plan. We have the network. We have the track record. We need the land.**
