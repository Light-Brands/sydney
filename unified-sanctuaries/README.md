## Overview

Unified Sanctuaries is a regenerative village integrating permaculture farming, healing arts, cultural programming, and cooperative living into a single, self-sustaining community. Conceived as a living laboratory for regenerative development, it operates at the intersection of ecological stewardship, community economics, and cultural innovation.

It is designed from the ground up as an **open-source blueprint** -- every governance framework, financial model, and operational design will be publicly shared so communities worldwide can adapt and replicate. Unified Sanctuaries is **a node, not the trunk** -- one expression among many, not the central thing that everything flows into or out of.

## The Four Pillars

| Pillar | Description | Annual Revenue Potential |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Permaculture Farm & Education Center** | Regenerative agriculture, food sovereignty, cafe, forest school | $315K -- $1M+ |
| **Retreat & Healing Arts Center + Bathhouse** | Somatic therapy, art therapy, herbalism, spa, makerspace | $570K -- $1.75M |
| **Event Venue + Innovation Hall** | Festivals, concerts, weddings, markets, conferences, AV production | $310K -- $1.16M |
| **Community Living / Regenerative Neighborhood** | Eco-homes, tiny dwellings, shared stewardship for 20+ households | $195K -- $580K |
| **Combined** | | **$1.4M -- $4.5M+ at maturity** |

## Economic Model

- **Sol Token (Utility)** -- Community currency for goods and services within the ecosystem
- **Voice Token (Governance)** -- Earned through participation and stewardship, granting decision-making weight
- **Trust Units** -- Earned through infrastructure development, liquidatable upon exit
- **Non-Speculative Land Stewardship** -- Land held in trust (Sol Community Land Project), permanently removed from market speculation

## Governance

Consent-based, rotating leadership blending sociocracy and holacracy principles:
- **Anchor Circle** -- Central governance body guiding interconnected autonomous platforms
- **Autonomous Nodes** -- Each pillar self-governs while remaining accountable to shared framework
- **Consent-Based Decisions** -- No one overruled; operational agility maintained
- **Rotating Leadership** -- Power distributed, leadership capacity developed across community

## What Makes It Unique

- **Non-speculative land model** -- property held in community land trust, permanently off-market
- **Contribution-based equity** -- stewardship and labor, not just capital, determine participation
- **Circular internal economy** -- community currency and governance tokens keep value local
- **Open-source blueprint** -- every system documented and shared for global replication
- **Multi-revenue resilience** -- four distinct but interconnected revenue pillars
- **Ecosystem integration** -- connected to but not dependent on Kinship Earth, Permatours, Planetary Party

## Capital Targets

| Milestone | Target | Timeline |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Seed / Phase 1 | **$10M** | End of 2026 |
| Growth / Phase 2+ | **$100M** | 2028 |
