# Unified Sanctuaries

> *Land-Based Project & Community -- Local (one site, Southern Vermont)*

Unified Sanctuaries is one physical expression of regenerative community -- a village integrating permaculture farming, a retreat and healing arts center, an event venue, and community living. It is a place where multiple streams can intersect: a site that could host Planetary Party gatherings, Permatours projects or trainings, and serve as a living example that Kinship Earth or others might point to as a case study. But it is **a node, not the trunk** -- one expression among many, not the central thing that everything flows into or out of. It is being designed as an open-source blueprint that other communities around the world could adapt.

## What It Is

A land-based regenerative community organized around four pillars:

1. **Permaculture Farm & Education Center** -- Regenerative agriculture, food sovereignty, a community cafe, and hands-on learning
2. **Retreat & Healing Arts Center + Bathhouse** -- Immersive retreats, somatic therapy, healing arts, and a spa/bathhouse
3. **Event Venue + Innovation Hall** -- Festivals, concerts, weddings, markets, conferences, and AV production
4. **Community Living / Regenerative Neighborhood** -- Eco-homes, tiny dwellings, shared stewardship, and cooperative living (20+ homes)

## Role in the Wider Movement

- **One possible venue** for Planetary Party gatherings -- PP serves many ecosystems, and US is one site among many
- **One hub among many** in the Permatours NE network -- not the center of the network
- Whether it **receives direct funding from Kinship Earth** is an open question (potential conflict of interest given shared stewardship)
- Generates **multi-stream revenue** (farm, retreat, venue, lodging, products) to sustain its own operations
- Operates a **circular economy** with community tokens that keep value local
- Designed as an **open-source blueprint** -- the real value is that other communities could adapt this model

## What Makes It Unique

- **Non-speculative land stewardship** -- held in trust, not subject to market speculation
- **Earned equity through contribution** -- stewardship, not just capital, determines participation
- **Anchor Circle governance** -- consent-based, rotating leadership with autonomous nodes
- **Circular economy** with Sol Token (utility) and Voice Token (governance)
- **Open-source blueprint** -- all designs, governance models, and practices shared for replication

## Current Status

**Phase**: Pre-acquisition / Planning
**Location Focus**: Southern Vermont (Brattleboro / Guilford / Putney)
**Existing Documentation**: Extensive -- see [`brands/unified-sanctuaries/`](../../unified-sanctuaries/) for full brand docs including:
- Vision documents and overviews
- Financial models and revenue projections ($1.4M - $4.5M+ annual potential across all pillars)
- Governance structure (Sol Community Land Project)
- Land acquisition criteria and outreach materials
- Website plan and brand identity system
- Full Next.js application

## Scoping Questions to Resolve

### Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] How does Unified Sanctuaries relate to the broader project ecosystem structurally? Is the existing `brands/unified-sanctuaries/` the canonical source, or does this folder become the home?
- [ ] How are event venue bookings coordinated with Planetary Party?
- [ ] What's the Permatours volunteer integration workflow on the ground?
- [ ] How does Kinship Earth funding flow into US operations? Through the trust? Directly to LLCs?

### Land Acquisition (Immediate Priority)
- [ ] Current status of land search?
- [ ] Entity structuring -- CLT (Community Land Trust) status?
- [ ] Capital raise progress and timeline?
- [ ] What can happen before land is acquired? (Community building, planning, programming at other venues)

### Pre-Land Phase Actions
- [ ] Can events and programming begin at temporary/partner venues while land is being acquired?
- [ ] What community-building activities can happen now?
- [ ] How does the team maintain momentum during the acquisition phase?

### Operations
- [ ] Trust and entity structure -- what's been established, what's pending?
- [ ] Team roles and gaps -- who's committed, who's needed?
- [ ] Budget for pre-acquisition phase operations?

## Initial Planning Steps

1. **Consolidate existing documentation** -- ensure the full body of work in `brands/unified-sanctuaries/` is referenced and leveraged, not duplicated
2. **Define the pre-land phase** -- what actions, events, and community-building can happen now
3. **Clarify entity relationships** -- how US trust/LLCs connect to Kinship Earth, Planetary Party, and Permatours legally
4. **Map the integration points** -- specific operational workflows between US and the other three projects
5. **Update the land acquisition strategy** -- current status, next steps, timeline

## Key People

- **Syd Harvey Griffith** -- The visionary behind Unified Sanctuaries and the connective force holding the entire four-project ecosystem together. As Executive Director of Kinship Earth, co-founder of Permatours, and lead designer of Planetary Party, Syd brings every thread of her work into this land project -- the physical anchor where regenerative finance meets regenerative living. A community organizer and movement builder who has supported 40+ land-based projects and pioneered trust-based flow funding, Syd is designing Unified Sanctuaries as more than a community -- it's an open-source blueprint for how we build, govern, and sustain regenerative villages. She's the systems designer, the capital strategist, the community weaver, and the person who will make sure the compost is right.

## Revenue Potential (From Financial Model)

| Pillar | Annual Potential |
|--------|-----------------|
| Farm, Agri-Tourism & Education | $315k - $1M+ |
| Retreat & Healing Arts + Bathhouse | $570k - $1.75M |
| Event Venue + Innovation Hall | $310k - $1.16M |
| Community Living | $195k - $580k |
| **Total** | **$1.4M - $4.5M+** |

## Connection Points

- **<-> Planetary Party**: Could host PP gatherings; PP serves many ecosystems, US is one possible venue
- **<-> Permatours**: One hub among many in the NE network; could host projects and trainings
- **<-> Kinship Earth**: KE may point to US as a case study; direct funding is an open question due to potential conflict of interest
- **-> Wider movement**: Designed as an open-source blueprint -- the model is meant to be adapted by other communities, not to be the center of everything

> **Important framing**: Unified Sanctuaries is a node, not the trunk. It's one expression among many -- a place where multiple streams can intersect, but not the central thing that everything flows into or out of.
