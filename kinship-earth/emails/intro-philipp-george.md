**Subject:** Intro: George Orbelian <> Dr. Philipp Staudacher -- Biodiversity Finance & Solution Matchmaking

---

Hi George, hi Philipp,

I'd love to connect you two. I think you'll find a lot of common ground and could be really valuable to each other.

**George** -- Philipp is the founder of Innovate for Nature, a Swiss foundation working to transform the economy toward something more planet-compatible. Their focus is mobilizing private finance for biodiversity by building coalitions that bring corporates, startups, foundations, and academia together around nature-positive solutions. Philipp holds a PhD from ETH Zurich in environmental science and has deep systems thinking around how capital and ecology intersect. He recently convened CEOs and decision-makers at a nature lunch during Davos, and his foundation does portfolio building (sourcing solutions), ecosystem building (convening the right people), and thought leadership. Importantly, Innovate for Nature originally started as a marketplace to connect investors with nature-positive startups -- a model they've since evolved based on hard-won lessons about what actually moves capital. I think his experience and perspective would be incredibly relevant to what you're building.

**Philipp** -- George is a board member at Kinship Earth and one of the most prolific network builders I know. He's deeply connected to funders, startups, and innovators across the biodiversity and ocean solutions space. George has been developing a concept for an AI-powered matchmaking platform to bridge the gap between nature-positive startups and investors -- which I know resonates directly with the journey Innovate for Nature has been on. He's also well connected to significant wealth and introduced us to one of Kinship Earth's major donors. I think he'd benefit greatly from your insights on what works (and what doesn't) in bringing investors and solutions together, and you may find a strong ally in him.

I'll let you two take it from here. I think there's real potential for shared learning and collaboration.

With love,
Syd
