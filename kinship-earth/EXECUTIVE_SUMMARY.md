# Kinship Earth — Executive Summary

## Overview

**Kinship Earth** is a private foundation stewarding **Flow Funding** — a participatory, trust-based grantmaking model that moves resources directly to grassroots leaders and bioregional organizers. No grant applications. Minimal reporting. Maximum trust.

Founded by **Sydney Griffith** (Executive Director) and **Susan Davis Mora** (Co-Founder), Kinship Earth exists to catalyze planetary regeneration and systemic healing by transforming how philanthropy functions. The organization serves as both **financial infrastructure** and **education platform**, addressing the structural gaps in traditional institutional philanthropy that keep resources locked away from the communities that need them most.

## The Problem

Traditional philanthropy is broken. The current system:

- **Locks up capital:** Foundations distribute only ~7% of assets annually — 93% stays locked up in endowments
- **Burdens changemakers:** Grassroots leaders spend countless hours finding grants and writing applications with no guarantee of funding, pulling them away from the work that matters
- **Enforces conformity:** Even when grants are awarded, recipients must conform to what foundations think they should do on the ground — not what communities actually need
- **Excludes the most effective actors:** Grassroots groups — often operating on less than $50,000/year — consistently deliver more effective, cost-efficient, and responsive solutions than top-down interventions, yet remain the most underfunded
- **Perpetuates inequity:** Indigenous peoples protect 80% of the world's biodiversity but receive less than 1% of climate finance

The systems designed to help are reinforcing the very inequities they claim to solve.

## The Solution: Flow Funding

Flow Funding is a **financial nervous system** that reliably moves resources where they're needed — not a one-off intervention, but a repeatable, durable system designed to function across time, bioregions, and cohorts.

### How It Works — Four Steps

**Step 1 — Identify Trusted Community Leaders**
Kinship Earth, guided by Flow Fund Advisors (grassroots leaders with deep bioregional ties), identifies trusted community leaders and organizations with established track records. If they accept the invitation to serve as a "Flow Funder," they receive **unrestricted funds** to deploy in service of their communities and ecosystems.

**Step 2 — Flow Funders Deploy Resources**
Flow Funders decide how, when, and where to move resources based on the emergent needs of their communities — **without submitting applications or asking permission**. Communities decide collectively how to deploy capital to heal the places they call home.

**Step 3 — Lightweight Reporting & Impact Stories**
Flow Funders share basic reports of how funds were deployed and are invited to share stories of impact: what surprised them, what moved them, what challenged them, what inspired them. This model — inspired by pioneer **Marian Rockefeller Weber** — replaces cumbersome compliance with relational accountability.

**Step 4 — Flow Funders Recommend the Next Round**
Flow Funders recommend the next cohort of trusted community leaders to receive funding, creating a **self-perpetuating, decentralized network** governed by trust, relationship, and accountability to life — not donor preference.

### What Makes Flow Funding Different

| Traditional Philanthropy | Flow Funding |
|---|---|
| Application-driven | Invitation-driven |
| Foundation controls decisions | Communities control decisions |
| Heavy compliance and reporting | Lightweight, story-based accountability |
| Siloed by issue area | Intersectional — economic, social, environmental, humanitarian |
| Organized by political boundaries | Organized by bioregions (natural ecosystems & culture) |
| Top-down power dynamics | Trust-based, relational |
| One-off grants | Repeatable, durable system |

### Flow Funding as a Public Good

Flow Funding is:
- **Repeatable and durable** — not one-off
- **Designed to function across time, bioregions, and cohorts**
- **Governed by trust, relationship, and accountability to life** — not donor preference
- **A public good-like system** that strengthens the entire field
- **Relational** — donors and recipients are invited into relationship and shared learning

### Real-World Examples

- **Food Sovereignty on Reservations:** A Flow Funder purchased a freeze dryer for a reservation so produce and herbs could be preserved through winter — strengthening nutrition, reducing reliance on processed foods, and building long-term community resilience.

- **Protecting Sacred Waters in Minnesota:** A Flow Funder helped prevent toxic mining waste from being dumped in a waterway — protecting sacred waters, uplifting treaty rights, preserving ecosystems, safeguarding community health, and affirming Indigenous sovereignty.

- **Family Food Security:** A Flow Funder expanded a program teaching families to grow food and raise chickens — creating lasting food security, self-sufficiency, and empowerment for families to care for themselves and each other.

- **Ozarks Bioregional Congress (October 2024):** Strengthened intergenerational networks, deepened ecological literacy, and catalyzed cross-state collaborations around land trusts, water stewardship, and community-rooted solutions.

| 10-year vision | **$200 million** raised and deployed |

### Where Capital Goes

- Renew grants to Cohorts 1 & 2 of Flow Funders
- Deploy flow funds to bioregional organizing groups around the world
- Help bioregional communities create their own unique Flow Funds and financially seed them
- Educate family offices, DAFs, high-net-worth individuals, and foundations on embracing flow funding

---

## Strategic Plan — Three Phases

### Phase 1: Capital & Cohort Continuity
- Renew grants to Cohorts 1 & 2 Flow Funders
- Support Flow Funders in deploying resources within their bioregions
- Strengthen internal governance, compliance, and reporting clarity

### Phase 2: Education & Field Building
- Develop clear educational materials for family offices, DAF holders, foundations, and high-net-worth individuals to practice flow funding
- Co-create the **Flow Funding Playbook** — a free, modular resource developed with grassroots leaders and aligned organizations to help communities launch their own flow funds

### Phase 3: Bioregional Scaling
- Support the emergence of autonomous, place-based Flow Funds worldwide
- Serve as backbone infrastructure — not a centralized controller:
  - **Legal** — fiscal sponsorship and compliance support
  - **Educational** — training, tools, and the Flow Funding Playbook
  - **Relational** — connecting bioregional leaders, facilitating shared learning

## The Broader Ecosystem

Kinship Earth operates within a constellation of four interconnected projects, all stewarded by Sydney Griffith. Each operates at a different scale with clear ethical boundaries:

### 1. Kinship Earth (Global — Flow Funding & Regenerative Capital)
The financial infrastructure layer. Bridges the philanthropic world and on-the-ground regenerative work. Serves many communities internationally — not primarily Sydney's other projects.

### 2. Planetary Party (Global — Cultural & Coordination Protocol)
A cultural coordination protocol — not just events — designed to serve many ecosystems. Produces bioregional gatherings and festivals that build relational fabric and deploy resources. Operates on a five-part rhythm: **Sense → See → Flow → Celebrate → Regenerate**. Pilot launch planned for spring 2026.

### 3. Permatours (Northeast Bioregion — Permaculture Action & Mutual Aid)
A bioregional network connecting permaculture practitioners across the Northeast through mutual aid and skill-sharing. Co-founded by Sydney Griffith, with a track record of supporting 40+ land-based projects. Flows resources outward to communities.

### 4. Unified Sanctuaries (Southern Vermont — Land-Based Regenerative Community)
A regenerative village in planning/pre-acquisition phase. Designed as an open-source blueprint other communities can adapt globally. One node in the network — not the center.

### Ethical Boundaries

A core principle is maintained across all projects: all four are **participants in a wider ecosystem**, not a closed loop. Kinship Earth capital flows serve many communities, with Sydney's projects as participants, not primary beneficiaries. Clear firewalls exist to prevent conflicts of interest.

## The Case for Flow Funding — Why Now

The convergence of ecological, social, and economic crises demands a fundamentally different approach to moving resources:

- **Catastrophic climate events** — floods, wildfires, and droughts are accelerating globally
- **Wars and displacement** — millions displaced, ecosystems devastated
- **Biodiversity collapse** — the most effective stewards (Indigenous communities) remain the most underfunded
- **Grassroots groups are the most effective responders** — yet they receive the least funding
- **A global bioregional resurgence is underway** — people all over the planet are gathering in their bioregions and working together, organized by natural ecosystems and culture rather than political boundaries. This approach has deep Indigenous roots.
- **Traditional philanthropy cannot meet this moment** — its bureaucracy, timelines, and power dynamics are structurally mismatched with the speed and trust required

Flow Funding is not an alternative to philanthropy. It is **philanthropy redesigned for the moment we're in.**
