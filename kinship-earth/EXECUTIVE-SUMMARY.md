# Kinship Earth -- Executive Summary

**Flow Funding & Regenerative Capital -- Global**

*Prepared: February 2026*

---

## Overview

**Kinship Earth** is a private foundation stewarding **Flow Funding** -- a participatory, trust-based grantmaking model that moves resources directly to grassroots leaders and bioregional organizers. No grant applications. Minimal reporting. Maximum trust.

Founded by **Sydney Griffith** (Executive Director) and **Susan Davis Mora** (Co-Founder), Kinship Earth exists to catalyze planetary regeneration and systemic healing by transforming how philanthropy functions. The organization serves as both **financial infrastructure** and **education platform**, addressing the structural gaps in traditional institutional philanthropy that keep resources locked away from the communities that need them most.

## The Problem

Traditional philanthropy is broken. The current system:

- **Locks up capital:** Foundations distribute only ~7% of assets annually -- 93% stays locked up in endowments
- **Burdens changemakers:** Grassroots leaders spend countless hours finding grants and writing applications with no guarantee of funding, pulling them away from the work that matters
- **Enforces conformity:** Even when grants are awarded, recipients must conform to what foundations think they should do -- not what communities actually need
- **Excludes the most effective actors:** Grassroots groups -- often operating on less than $50,000/year -- consistently deliver more effective, cost-efficient, and responsive solutions, yet remain the most underfunded
- **Perpetuates inequity:** Indigenous peoples protect 80% of the world's biodiversity but receive less than 1% of climate finance

The systems designed to help are reinforcing the very inequities they claim to solve.

## The Solution: Flow Funding

Flow Funding is a **financial nervous system** that reliably moves resources where they're needed -- not a one-off intervention, but a repeatable, durable system designed to function across time, bioregions, and cohorts.

### How It Works -- Four Steps

**Step 1 -- Identify Trusted Community Leaders**
Kinship Earth, guided by Flow Fund Advisors (grassroots leaders with deep bioregional ties), identifies trusted community leaders and organizations with established track records. If they accept the invitation to serve as a "Flow Funder," they receive **unrestricted funds** to deploy in service of their communities and ecosystems.

**Step 2 -- Flow Funders Deploy Resources**
Flow Funders decide how, when, and where to move resources based on the emergent needs of their communities -- **without submitting applications or asking permission**. Communities decide collectively how to deploy capital to heal the places they call home.

**Step 3 -- Lightweight Reporting & Impact Stories**
Flow Funders share basic reports of how funds were deployed and are invited to share stories of impact. This model -- inspired by pioneer **Marian Rockefeller Weber** -- replaces cumbersome compliance with relational accountability.

**Step 4 -- Flow Funders Recommend the Next Round**
Flow Funders recommend the next cohort of trusted community leaders to receive funding, creating a **self-perpetuating, decentralized network** governed by trust, relationship, and accountability to life -- not donor preference.

### What Makes Flow Funding Different

| Traditional Philanthropy | Flow Funding |
|---|---|
| Application-driven | Invitation-driven |
| Foundation controls decisions | Communities control decisions |
| Heavy compliance and reporting | Lightweight, story-based accountability |
| Siloed by issue area | Intersectional -- economic, social, environmental, humanitarian |
| Organized by political boundaries | Organized by bioregions (natural ecosystems & culture) |
| Top-down power dynamics | Trust-based, relational |
| One-off grants | Repeatable, durable system |

### Impact Areas Funded

1. Regeneration of natural systems
2. Advancing Indigenous rights and land rematriation
3. Strengthening food sovereignty, food security, and housing security
4. Supporting social justice and economic equity
5. Backing community-led disaster preparedness and relief
6. Improving ecosystem and human health

### Real-World Examples

- **Food Sovereignty on Reservations:** A Flow Funder purchased a freeze dryer for a reservation so produce and herbs could be preserved through winter -- strengthening nutrition, reducing reliance on processed foods, and building long-term community resilience.
- **Protecting Sacred Waters in Minnesota:** A Flow Funder helped prevent toxic mining waste from being dumped in a waterway -- protecting sacred waters, uplifting treaty rights, preserving ecosystems, and affirming Indigenous sovereignty.
- **Family Food Security:** A Flow Funder expanded a program teaching families to grow food and raise chickens -- creating lasting food security, self-sufficiency, and empowerment.
- **Ozarks Bioregional Congress (October 2024):** Strengthened intergenerational networks, deepened ecological literacy, and catalyzed cross-state collaborations around land trusts, water stewardship, and community-rooted solutions.

## Fundraising Goals

| Timeframe | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Near-term (2025-2026) | **$2 million** by end of 2026 |
| Medium-term (2026-2028) | **$20 million** by end of 2028 |
| 5-year target | **$10 million+** deployed through **100+ flow funding grants** |
| 5-year target | **20+ bioregional flow funds** created |
| 10-year vision | **$200 million** raised and deployed |

### Where Capital Goes

- Renew grants to Cohorts 1 & 2 of Flow Funders
- Deploy flow funds to bioregional organizing groups around the world
- Help bioregional communities create their own unique Flow Funds and financially seed them
- Educate family offices, DAFs, high-net-worth individuals, and foundations on embracing flow funding

---

## Strategic Plan -- Three Phases

### Phase 1: Capital & Cohort Continuity
- Renew grants to Cohorts 1 & 2 Flow Funders
- Support Flow Funders in deploying resources within their bioregions
- Strengthen internal governance, compliance, and reporting clarity

### Phase 2: Education & Field Building
- Develop educational materials for family offices, DAF holders, foundations, and high-net-worth individuals
- Co-create the **Flow Funding Playbook** -- a free, modular resource to help communities launch their own flow funds

### Phase 3: Bioregional Scaling
- Support the emergence of autonomous, place-based Flow Funds worldwide
- Serve as backbone infrastructure -- not a centralized controller:
  - **Legal** -- fiscal sponsorship and compliance support
  - **Educational** -- training, tools, and the Flow Funding Playbook
  - **Relational** -- connecting bioregional leaders, facilitating shared learning

## Ecosystem Context

Kinship Earth operates within a constellation of four interconnected projects, all stewarded by Sydney Griffith:

| Initiative | Role | Scale |
|------------|------|-------|
| **Kinship Earth** | Flow Funding & Regenerative Capital | Global |
| **Planetary Party** | Cultural & Coordination Protocol | Global |
| **Permatours** | Permaculture Action & Mutual Aid | Northeast Bioregion |
| **Unified Sanctuaries** | Land-Based Regenerative Village | Local (Southern Vermont) |

**Core principle:** All four are **participants in a wider ecosystem**, not a closed loop. Kinship Earth capital flows serve many communities, with Sydney's projects as participants, not primary beneficiaries. Clear firewalls exist to prevent conflicts of interest.

## The Case for Flow Funding -- Why Now

- **Catastrophic climate events** -- floods, wildfires, and droughts are accelerating globally
- **Wars and displacement** -- millions displaced, ecosystems devastated
- **Biodiversity collapse** -- the most effective stewards (Indigenous communities) remain the most underfunded
- **Grassroots groups are the most effective responders** -- yet they receive the least funding
- **A global bioregional resurgence is underway** -- people gathering in their bioregions, organized by natural ecosystems rather than political boundaries
- **Traditional philanthropy cannot meet this moment** -- its bureaucracy, timelines, and power dynamics are structurally mismatched with the speed and trust required

Flow Funding is not an alternative to philanthropy. It is **philanthropy redesigned for the moment we're in.**
