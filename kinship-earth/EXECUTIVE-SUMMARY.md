# Kinship Earth -- Executive Summary

## Overview

Kinship Earth is a private foundation stewarding **Flow Funding** -- a participatory, trust-based grantmaking model that moves unrestricted resources directly to grassroots leaders and bioregional organizers. No grant applications. Minimal reporting. Grounded in trust and in the wisdom of those closest to their communities' needs. Founded by **Stephen Gomes**, **Susan Davis Moora**, and **Walter Moora**, Kinship Earth exists to catalyze planetary regeneration by transforming how philanthropy functions. In 2024, **Sydney Griffith** was brought on as Executive Director to lead the organization's pivot to embracing Flow Funding as its primary objective. The organization serves as both **financial infrastructure** and **education platform**, addressing the structural gaps in traditional institutional philanthropy that keep resources locked away from the communities that need them most.

## Mission & Vision

**Mission:** To catalyze planetary regeneration and systemic healing by transforming how philanthropy functions -- moving unrestricted capital directly to trusted grassroots leaders and bioregional organizing groups through participatory, trust-based grant-making.

**Vision:** A world where financial resources reliably flow to the communities and ecosystems that need them most -- governed by trust, relationship, and accountability to life rather than bureaucracy, compliance, and donor preference. Flow Funding is not an alternative to philanthropy. It is philanthropy redesigned for the moment we're in.

---

## The Problem

Traditional philanthropy is structurally broken:

- **Locks up capital:** Foundations distribute only ~7% of assets annually -- 93% stays locked in endowments
- **Burdens changemakers:** Grassroots leaders spend countless hours finding grants and writing applications, pulling them away from the work that matters
- **Enforces conformity:** Recipients oftentimes must conform to what foundations think they should do -- not what communities actually need
- **Excludes the most effective actors:** Grassroots groups -- often operating on less than $50,000/year -- consistently deliver more effective, cost-efficient, and responsive solutions, yet remain the most underfunded
- **Perpetuates inequity:** Indigenous peoples protect 80% of the world's biodiversity but receive less than 1% of climate finance

---

## The Core Model: Flow Funding

Flow Funding is a **financial nervous system** that reliably moves resources where they're needed -- not a one-off intervention, but a repeatable, durable system designed to function across time, bioregions, and cohorts.

### How It Works -- Four Steps

    style S4 fill:#AB47BC,stroke:#7B1FA2,color:#fff
```

1. **Identify Trusted Community Leaders** -- Kinship Earth, guided by its Flow Fund Advisors and leadership team with deep bioregional ties, identifies trusted community leaders, non profits, and bioregional organizing groups. If they accept the invitation, they receive **unrestricted funds** to deploy in service of their communities.
2. **Flow Funders Deploy Resources** -- Flow Funders decide how, when, and where to move resources based on emergent community needs -- **without submitting applications or asking permission**.
3. **Lightweight Reporting & Impact Stories** -- Flow Funders share basic reports and are invited to share stories of impact. This model replaces cumbersome compliance with relational accountability.
4. **Flow Funders Recommend the Next Round** -- Flow Funders recommend the next cohort of trusted community leaders, creating a **self-perpetuating network** governed by trust and accountability to life.

### What Makes Flow Funding Different

| Traditional Philanthropy | Flow Funding |
|---|---|
| Application-driven | Invitation-driven |
| Foundation controls decisions | Communities control decisions |
| Heavy compliance and reporting | Lightweight, story-based accountability |
| Siloed by issue area | Intersectional -- economic, social, environmental, humanitarian |
| Organized by political boundaries | Organized by bioregions (natural ecosystems & culture) |
| Top-down power dynamics | Trust-based, relational |
| One-off grants | Repeatable, durable system |

### Four Core Functions

1. Deploy unrestricted grants to trusted changemakers and bioregional organizing groups
2. Educate donors, family offices, DAFs, and foundations on trust-based philanthropy
3. Support communities in establishing their own Flow Funding foundations
4. Serve as both grantmaker and field-builder for the broader movement

### Impact Areas Funded

1. Regeneration of natural systems
2. Advancing Indigenous rights and land rematriation
3. Strengthening food sovereignty, food security, and housing security
4. Supporting social justice and economic equity
5. Backing community-led disaster preparedness and relief
6. Improving ecosystem and human health

```

### Phase 1 -- Capital & Cohort Continuity (Q4 2024 - present)
- Flow Funding to 3 Cohorts
- Supporting Bioregional Organizing Groups with creating their own Flow Funding Foundations
- Educating Family Offices, Foundations, DAFs, and high net worth individuals on how and why to practice Flow Funding

### Phase 2 -- Education & Field Building (Q1 2026 - Q4 2026)
- Publish a **Bioregional Flow Funding Playbook** -- a free, modular resource to help communities launch their own flow funds (Q1, 2026)
- Renew grants to Flow Funders in Cohort 1 & 2
- Refine our Community of Practice Processes for Cohort 3, just beginning (Q1, 2026)

### Phase 3 -- Bioregional Scaling (Q4 2026 onwards)
- Support the emergence of autonomous, place-based Flow Funds worldwide
- Serve as backbone infrastructure -- not a centralized controller, offering:
  - **Legal** -- compliance support
  - **Educational** -- training, tools, and the Flow Funding Playbook
  - **Relational** -- connecting bioregional leaders, facilitating shared learning

## What Makes Kinship Earth Unique

1. **Flow funding model** -- capital moves where needed, not locked in rigid program budgets
2. **Many-communities approach** -- deploys across bioregions internationally, not just a small internal network
3. **Invitation-driven** -- no grant applications; communities control decisions
4. **Organized by bioregions** -- natural ecosystems and culture, not political boundaries
5. **Self-perpetuating network** -- each cohort of Flow Funders recommends the next, creating decentralized growth
6. **Storytelling-integrated fundraising** -- content from across the movement supports donor cultivation
7. **Field-building mission** -- not just deploying capital but helping communities build their own Flow Funds
8. **Pioneer lineage** -- direct intellectual and relational lineage from Marion Rockefeller Weber's original flow funding vision

---

## Key Risks & Open Questions

- **Fundraising execution:** Achieving $2M by end of 2026 and $20M by 2028 requires significant donor cultivation and foundation engagement
- **Scaling without centralizing:** As bioregional Flow Funds emerge, maintaining coherence and accountability without imposing top-down control
- **Flow Funder accountability:** Balancing trust-based, lightweight reporting with sufficient transparency for donors and foundations
- **Institutional credibility:** Building the organizational track record to unlock larger institutional grants and foundation partnerships
- **Sustainability:** Transitioning from founder-dependent fundraising to a self-sustaining model with diversified revenue

---

## Summary

Kinship Earth represents a fundamental redesign of how philanthropic capital reaches the communities and ecosystems that need it most. With $800,000 raised since August 2024 and $370,000 deployed thus far across 23 Flow Funders in 12+ bioregions, the model has demonstrated real traction. Beyond deploying capital, Kinship Earth is actively educating philanthropists and foundations in trust-based, participatory approaches to giving, while supporting bioregional communities to design and launch their own Flow Funds. This trust-based accountability structure and bioregional resourcing focus position Kinship Earth to scale from a proven model into a global learning and deployment infrastructure for regenerative capital - targeting $200M raised and deployed over the next decade.
