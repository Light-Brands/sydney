> *Flow Funding & Regenerative Capital -- Global*

**Website:** [kinshipearth.org](https://www.kinshipearth.org/) | [flowfunding.org](https://flowfunding.org)
**Entity:** Private Foundation (Nonprofit 501c3)
**Scale:** Global
**Status:** Active -- deploying flow funds across 12+ bioregions

## Overview

Kinship Earth is a private foundation stewarding **Flow Funding** -- a participatory, trust-based grantmaking model that moves unrestricted resources directly to grassroots leaders and bioregional organizers. No grant applications. Minimal reporting. Maximum trust.

Founded by **Sydney Griffith** (Executive Director) and **Susan Davis Mora** (Co-Founder), Kinship Earth exists to catalyze planetary regeneration by transforming how philanthropy functions. The organization serves as both **financial infrastructure** and **education platform**, addressing the structural gaps in traditional philanthropy that keep resources locked away from the communities that need them most.

## How Flow Funding Works

1. **Identify** trusted community leaders through Flow Fund Advisors with deep bioregional ties
2. **Deploy** unrestricted funds -- communities decide how, when, and where capital moves
3. **Report** through lightweight, story-based accountability -- not compliance paperwork
4. **Recommend** the next cohort of Flow Funders, creating a self-perpetuating, decentralized network

## Impact to Date

- **$800,000+** raised since adopting Flow Funding in 2024
- **$300,000+** deployed to **18+ Flow Funders** across **12+ bioregions** globally
- **$150,000** grant received from NOBO/Novo Foundation
- Active across the Ozarks, Cascadia, Greater Tkaronto, NE Turtle Island, Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico, Guatemala
- Real-world outcomes: food sovereignty on reservations, protection of sacred waters, family food security programs, the Ozarks Bioregional Congress

## What Makes It Unique

- **Flow funding model** -- capital moves where needed, not locked in rigid program budgets
- **Many-communities approach** -- deploys across bioregions internationally, not just a small internal network
- **Invitation-driven** -- no grant applications; communities control decisions
- **Organized by bioregions** -- natural ecosystems and culture, not political boundaries
- **Storytelling-integrated fundraising** -- content from across the movement supports donor cultivation

## Four Core Functions

1. Deploy unrestricted grants to trusted changemakers
2. Educate donors, family offices, DAFs, and foundations on trust-based philanthropy
3. Support communities in establishing their own Flow Funding foundations
4. Serve as both grantmaker and field-builder for the broader movement

## Key People

- **Susan Davis Mora** -- Co-Founder; original flow funding recipient (early 1990s from Marian Rockefeller Weber)

## Funding Targets

| Timeframe | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Near-term | **$2M** by end of 2026 |
| Medium-term | **$20M** by end of 2028 |
| 5-year | **$10M+** deployed through **100+ grants**; **20+ bioregional Flow Funds** created |
| 10-year vision | **$200M** raised and deployed |

## Ethical Boundaries

- KE's capital flows serve many communities internationally, not primarily Syd's own projects
- KE -> Permatours: flow funds deployed so Permatours could flow resources **outward** to communities
- KE -> Unified Sanctuaries: direct funding is an open question due to potential conflict of interest

## Connection Points

- **Planetary Party** -- KE serves as fiscal sponsor; provides financial backbone for PPP ecosystem
- **Permatours** -- Has deployed flow funds so Permatours could flow resources outward to communities
- **Unified Sanctuaries** -- May reference as case study; direct funding carefully managed with firewalls
- **Many communities** -- Primary purpose is deploying capital across bioregions internationally
