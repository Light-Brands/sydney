# Kinship Earth

> *Flow Funding & Regenerative Capital -- Global*

Kinship Earth is a nonprofit deploying flow funds across multiple bioregions and communities internationally. Its goal is to unlock capacity for **many communities**, not just reinforce a small internal network. Syd Harvey Griffith serves as Executive Director -- leading the charge to fundamentally reshape how capital flows in the regenerative space. Kinship Earth maintains important ethical boundaries around how it relates to Syd's other projects.

## What It Is

A nonprofit organization focused on:

- **Grant acquisition** -- researching, applying for, and managing grants from foundations, government programs, and impact funds
- **Flow funding** -- facilitating the movement of philanthropic capital to where it's needed across bioregions and communities internationally
- **Fiscal sponsorship** -- potentially providing fiscal infrastructure for aligned projects
- **Donor engagement** -- cultivating relationships with individual donors, family foundations, and institutional funders
- **Impact reporting** -- documenting and communicating the social, ecological, and community impact of the ecosystem

Kinship Earth is the bridge between the philanthropic world and the on-the-ground regenerative work.

## Role in the Wider Movement

- Deploys **flow funds across multiple bioregions and communities internationally** -- not just to Syd's other projects
- Channels **flow funding grants** for land acquisition, infrastructure, and community development across many communities
- Offers potential **fiscal sponsorship** for aligned projects
- Manages **impact measurement and reporting** that satisfies funders and attracts new capital
- Brings **institutional credibility** that opens doors for grassroots leaders and communities

### Ethical Boundaries (In Development)

- **Kinship Earth -> Unified Sanctuaries**: Whether KE should fund US directly is an open question -- it may represent a conflict of interest given that Syd stewards both
- **Kinship Earth -> Permatours**: KE has deployed flow funds to Permatours in the past, but specifically so Permatours could flow resources **outward** to community members and ecosystems, not to fund its own internal operations
- **General principle**: KE's capital flows are meant to serve many communities internationally, not primarily resource Syd's own projects

## What Makes It Unique

- **Flow funding model** -- capital moves to where it's most needed, not locked into rigid program budgets
- **Many-communities approach** -- deploys capital across bioregions and communities internationally, not just to a small internal network
- **Storytelling-integrated fundraising** -- content from across the movement supports donor cultivation
- **Aligned values** -- funding supports non-speculative, community-governed, land-based projects
- **Storytelling-driven** -- the media and content produced by the ecosystem becomes the case for support

## Scoping Questions to Resolve

### Organizational Status
- [ ] What is Kinship Earth's current legal status? Active 501(c)(3)? State of incorporation?
- [ ] What's the current board composition?
- [ ] Is Sydney the sole staff member, or are there others?
- [ ] What's the current annual budget and funding pipeline?

### Funding Strategy
- [ ] What grant programs are being targeted? (USDA, state conservation, family foundations, climate funds?)
- [ ] What's the flow funding strategy? Who are the flow funders in the network?
- [ ] What's the donor cultivation pipeline? Major donors, mid-level, grassroots?
- [ ] Capital campaign planning for Unified Sanctuaries land acquisition?
- [ ] What's the earned revenue model, if any? (Consulting, training, publications?)

### Fiscal Relationships & Ethical Boundaries
- [ ] Does Kinship Earth fiscally sponsor any of the other three projects currently?
- [ ] What's the planned entity structure? Should Planetary Party and Permatours be programs of KE, or separate entities?
- [ ] Is it a conflict of interest for KE to fund Unified Sanctuaries directly? (Open question -- needs careful consideration)
- [ ] How should flow funds to Permatours be structured to ensure resources flow outward to communities, not inward to internal operations?
- [ ] What ethical boundaries should govern how KE relates financially to Syd's other projects?

### Impact & Reporting
- [ ] What metrics and impact data are currently being tracked?
- [ ] What reporting frameworks are in use? (IRIS+, custom, funder-specific?)
- [ ] How is the ecosystem's collective impact measured and communicated?

### Digital Presence
- [ ] Current website status and needs?
- [ ] Donor communication channels -- newsletter, social, annual report?
- [ ] Online donation infrastructure -- platform, recurring giving, campaign pages?

## Initial Planning Steps

1. **Audit current status** -- document Kinship Earth's legal status, board, budget, and active grants
2. **Map the funding landscape** -- identify target grant programs, foundations, and flow funding networks aligned with KE's mission
3. **Define ethical boundaries** -- clarify how KE relates financially to Syd's other projects, including potential conflicts of interest
4. **Define the fiscal architecture** -- how money flows between KE and aligned projects, with clear boundaries and transparency
5. **Build the case for support** -- a compelling narrative document that positions KE's global flow funding mission
6. **Set up donor engagement pipeline** -- cultivate relationships that support many communities, not just a small internal network

## Key People

- **Syd Harvey Griffith** -- Executive Director and the architect of Kinship Earth's trust-based funding model. Syd leads the organization's Bioregional Flow Funding efforts, shifting financial decision-making away from institutional gatekeepers and into the hands of grassroots leaders embedded in their communities. Under her leadership, resources move without grant applications or burdensome reporting -- just direct, flexible capital flowing to change-makers healing the places they call home. A community organizer and movement builder who has supported 40+ land-based projects, Syd brings the rare combination of grassroots credibility and institutional fluency that makes funders trust the vision and communities trust the process.
- **Michael (Fuego)** -- Financial operations, accounting, compliance

## Grant & Funding Targets to Research

- USDA Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development
- USDA Community Facilities Direct Loan & Grant Program
- Vermont Housing & Conservation Board (VHCB)
- Vermont Community Foundation
- Climate and soil carbon credit programs
- Family foundations focused on regenerative agriculture, land access, community resilience
- Flow funding networks (e.g., RSF Social Finance, Thousand Currents)
- Impact investors focused on regenerative real estate / land stewardship

## Connection Points

- **<-> Unified Sanctuaries**: May reference as case study; direct funding is an open question (potential conflict of interest)
- **<-> Planetary Party**: Storytelling content supports broader fundraising; relationship is collaborative, not financially circular
- **<-> Permatours**: Has deployed flow funds so Permatours could flow resources outward to communities -- not to fund internal operations
- **-> Many communities**: KE's primary purpose is deploying capital across bioregions and communities internationally
- **-> Wider movement**: Provides institutional credibility and financial infrastructure for grassroots leaders and communities beyond Syd's projects
