## **🌿 Bioregional Flow Funding Playbook & Resource Library**

**Contribution Form**

**We’re so glad you’re here.**  
This Playbook is a collaborative effort, and we’re honored you’re considering contributing to it.

We’re currently gathering tools, templates, agreements, models, and stories to support the growth of **Flow Funding** \- especially in its **bioregional forms** \- and to provide practical resources for organizing groups working toward **place-based regeneration and community resilience**.

While this began as a project focused on Flow Funding, it has expanded into a **modular, evolving resource** that uplifts a wider ecosystem of practices rooted in **trust, reciprocity, and local knowledge**. It’s being designed to help communities move resources with care and clarity—while also supporting governance, coordination, and relationship-building at the bioregional scale.

Our intention is to **publish the first iteration of the Playbook in June 2025** on Kinship Earth’s website, with additional modules and updates added over time as new contributions and feedback come in.

In addition to resources developed by Kinship Earth, the Playbook will include and link to relevant tools, frameworks, and stories created by **other practitioners and organizations** in the field—with permission—so that readers can learn from a diversity of approaches.

We welcome contributions from grassroots leaders, funders, facilitators, technologists, land stewards, researchers, and others bringing bioregional visions and community-led resource flow to life.

If you’ve created or practiced something that aligns with the spirit of this Playbook, we invite you to share it. Whether it’s a tool, process, model, or story, your offering could support others navigating similar paths and help shape this evolving, community-informed resource.
