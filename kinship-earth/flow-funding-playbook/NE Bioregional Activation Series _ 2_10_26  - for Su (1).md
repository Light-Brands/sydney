## **Bridging Bioregional Wisdom in the Northeast of Turtle Island**

A Co-Created Bioregional Activation Series  
Proposal by Susanna Choe and Syd Harvey Griffith

### **Invitation to Hudson Harmonic Team**

We’re reaching out to invite the Hudson Harmonic team into a **co-creative partnership** around a bioregional gathering series we are stewarding, *Bridging Bioregional Wisdom in the Northeast of Turtle Island* \- emerging from ongoing work across bioregional organizing, regenerative finance, land-based hubs, governance education, and culture-building in the Northeast. 

The success of the series depends on **co-creation** \- with trusted spaces, facilitators, and anchors like Hudson Harmonic.

Our proposal is to **listen together**, refine the shape of the series, and design what feels most aligned for your space, our shared community, and the NE bioregion.

## **Purpose & Mission**

The mission of this series is to **co-create \- alongside experienced community leaders, organizers, and practitioners \- the relational, governance, and coordination foundations needed to resource a thriving Northeast bioregion**.

The series is being designed to:

* Surface **who is already doing this kind of work**  
* Understand **the status of their efforts and what they need**  
* Increase **visibility, trust, and collaboration** among those with shared goals

## **Desired Outcomes**

We aim to collaboratively support:

1. **The launch of a Northeast Bioregional Flow Fund**  
   A trust-based, participatory funding mechanism rooted in relationship and local stewardship.  
2. **The launch of a Northeast Bioregional Currency / Token**  
   A practical coordination and exchange tool (with governance/voice layers explored when the bioregion is ready).  
3. **The development and fundraising capacity of Northeast bioregional land-based hubs (e.g. Bioregional Finance Facilities)**  
4. **Practicing Commitment Pooling across the bioregion \-** coordinating time, skills, relationships, land access, and funding to strengthen collaboration  
5. Preparing to **co-create a NE bioregional (leave-a-positive-trace) festival**, with support from the “[Planetary Party Protocol](https://www.planetaryparty.com/)”

Overall, supporting shared resourcing, knowledge exchange, trade, and mutual aid \- while reducing dependency on extractive systems and long-distance supply chains.

## **PILLARS**

## **Relationship-Building & Mapping**

The **first and foundational pillar** of the series is **relationship-building and mapping**:

* Who is already stewarding land, capital, governance, culture, or exchange?  
* What systems, tools, or funding models are in motion?  
* Where are the natural synergies, overlaps, or opportunities for collaboration?

This pillar focuses on **coherence-building**, not speed \- so that any structures that emerge are rooted in trust and shared understanding.

## **Governance Education** 

Governance education will be woven throughout the series as **living infrastructure** through:

* Shared language around decision-making, stewardship, and accountability  
* Exposure to participatory, bioregional, and commons-based governance models  
* Practical support for co-creation across difference without fragmentation

This supports collaboration that can hold over time.

## **Tools, Tech & Frameworks**

An important thread of the series is **surfacing and convening the tools, technologies, and frameworks already supporting this movement**, including (but not limited to):

* Mapping and coordination tools  
* Participatory governance frameworks  
* Regenerative finance and funding infrastructure  
* Storytelling, data, and visibility platforms

Our intention is to **invite the people and organizations building these tools into the series** so the bioregion can understand what’s available, what’s interoperable, and what’s missing, (and to **organically align around shared infrastructure**).

## **Healing & Conflict Transformation (Responsive, Not Centered)**

We recognize that **every community carries friction points, historical wounds, and unresolved tensions** that can block collaboration.

Healing and conflict transformation will be made **available in tandem with the series**, supported by skilled facilitators **as needed**.

When conflict surfaces, we plan to make space for them to be:

* Acknowledged  
* Held with care  
* Integrated without derailing the broader work

….to keep the series grounded and responsive.

## **Honoring Place: The Great Law of Peace**

The series will center the **Haudenosaunee Great Law of Peace**, which united the Iroquois Confederacy and influenced American democracy.

As the United States approaches its 250th anniversary, we see this as a moment to:

* Center Indigenous governance wisdom  
* Connect bioregional governance to healing, celebration, and responsibility to place  
* Honor the land and the lineages of collective governance rooted in the Northeast

This grounding informs how we approach **bioregional governance, reconciliation, and future-facing collaboration**.

## **Culture, Arts & Creative Expression**

Artists, musicians, storytellers, and culture bearers are essential contributors to the bioregional field. Throughout the series, we will invite:

* Music, visual art, and creative storytelling rooted in place  
* Cultural offerings that reflect regenerative values and bioregional identity  
* Artists and culture bearers to contribute expressions that deepen meaning and inspiration

**Art as Living Infrastructure**

## Creative expression will be welcomed as a form of cultural infrastructure \- supporting shared identity, celebration, and imaginative vision alongside the structural work of the series.

## **Resourcing the Series**

Kinship Earth is contributing **$7,500 in seed funding** to support this series, aligned with its mission to not only practice Flow Funding, but to **help bioregional organizing groups prepare for and launch their own unique Flow Funding Foundations**.

We see this series as a powerful way to **prepare the Northeast bioregion** \- relationally, structurally, and culturally \- for such a launch.

Kinship Earth is also **raising matching funds** to further resource:

* The series itself  
* Facilitators, organizers, artists, contributors  
* Tools, mapping, and coordination infrastructure  
* Those helping bring this work into form

## **Proposed Series Flow**

We offer the following flow as a **starting point**, open to evolution based on community needs and what emerges during the sessions:

### **1\. Online Preparation Sessions (1–2 Sessions)**

* Introduce the series, purpose, and desired outcomes  
* Orientation to bioregional context and shared language  
* Invitation for participants to begin **mapping work in advance** \- so a living map exists when we gather in person

### **2\. In-Person Gathering at Hudson Harmonic**

* Relationship and trust building   
* Embodied sensemaking and integration  
* Governance practice, storytelling, and design labs  
* Translating mapped insights into lived connection and next steps

Hudson Harmonic is envisioned as a **central relational anchor** for this work.

### **3\. Distributed Bioregional Hub Gatherings (Other In-person Gatherings)**

* Partner-hosted activations at farms, community centers, and land-based hubs  
* Locally relevant expressions connected back to shared learning and coordination

## **Invitation to Co-Create**

We’d love to explore with you:

* What feels aligned to co-create around  
* How Hudson Harmonic’s values and community inform the series   
* What role feels sustainable and life-giving for your space and collaborators

Our intention is to **co-create a living series** that serves Earth, people, and the moment we’re in.
