**Kinship Earth Flow Funding Paybook** 

**Preface: Reimagining How Resources Flow**

At Kinship Earth, our mission is to practice and expand Flow Funding and Bioregional Flow Funding — transforming how money moves in service to life. We are here to help bioregional organizing groups create their own Flow Funds, and to educate wealth holders, foundations, and family offices to allocate a portion of their resources in this way — because this model works, and because the systems of traditional philanthropy no longer serve the moment we are in.

For decades, philanthropy has been centralized, bureaucratic, and extractive. Decision-making power has rested far from the communities most affected by the challenges being addressed. Grant applications and reporting requirements often uphold inequity and gatekeeping, reinforcing dependency rather than autonomy. As a result, those closest to the land, the people, and the solutions are too often left out of the flow of resources — while those with wealth are distanced from the real impact their giving could have.

Flow Funding was created by Marion Rockefeller Weber to offer another way. Instead of concentrating control, it entrusts decision-making to people already doing the work on the ground — community leaders, artists, healers, educators, and organizers. Flow Funding is rooted in trust, relationship, and direct impact. It recognizes that generosity, like water, must move freely to nourish what is alive and emergent.

Through Bioregional Flow Funding, Kinship Earth carries this approach forward — guiding local groups to design their own place-based funding ecosystems that channel wealth to regenerative efforts within their regions: restoring land and water, uplifting grassroots leadership, and strengthening the fabric of community and culture.

Our work also honors the legacy of Susan Davis Moora, who pioneered collaborative models for social innovation through the KINS Networks — bringing together circles of changemakers to advance environmental and social healing. Today, we carry forward the spirit of both Marion and Susan by evolving these principles into living systems for systemic healing and shared stewardship of Earth.

We believe this is a time to re-design not only how money moves, but why — to heal the disconnect between wealth and life, to shift from charity to kinship, and to cultivate regenerative economies rooted in trust, participation, and care.

The resources that follow were created to support bioregional communities, networks, and organizing groups who are ready to begin this journey — to create their own Flow Funding Foundations, tap into local and aligned global wealth, and flow resources in service of their communities, ecosystems, and shared future.

Together, we are building a new culture of giving — one that heals systems, uplifts communities, and allows generosity to flow where it’s needed most.

**How to Use These Resources**

The following resources have been developed and refined through Kinship Earth’s experience practicing Flow Funding and Bioregional Flow Funding. They are designed to help bioregional organizing groups, networks, and communities create their own Flow Funds, adapt the model to their local context, and begin channeling resources with trust and intention.

Each document can be adapted to meet the cultural, legal, and ecological realities of your place. We encourage you to see these not as rigid templates, but as living tools to help your group establish clarity, accountability, and flow.
