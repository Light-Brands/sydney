### **1\. INTRODUCTION & INVITATION**

We are living in a time of deep unraveling—and profound possibility.

Everywhere we look, communities are rising to meet the interwoven crises of climate collapse, economic inequity, and cultural disconnection with place-based solutions that heal land and regenerate life. Yet the systems meant to support them \- especially philanthropy \- have not kept pace.

The Bioregional Flow Funding Playbook was created to help shift that reality. It is a living, evolving resource designed to support grassroots leaders, community organizers, and land stewards in exploring and practicing trust-based, locally rooted ways of moving resources.

Our vision is to help cultivate a network of Bioregional Flow Funding nodes \- each shaped by the relationships, ecosystems, and cultures of place. This playbook is one way we’re nurturing that network \- as a fellow learner in a growing community of practice. It’s an offering \- emergent, incomplete, and shaped by many.

It includes:

* Templated agreements, tools, processes, and prompts to help you design a Flow Fund aligned with your context  
* Stories and practices from Flow Funding practitioners   
* Wisdom from across the fields of Flow Funding, bioregional organizing, grassroots regenerative action, participatory grant making, governance, permaculture, and collective care  
* A directory of aligned technologies, frameworks, and Communities of Practice and learning

Whether you’re already raising and moving funds or just beginning to explore capital deployment in service of your bioregion, this guide can help you assess your readiness, spark ideas, and root your work in the fundamentals of Flow Funding: relationship and trust.

This is not a manual for replication. It’s a shared field of experimentation. Our vision is for each new Flow Fund to strengthen a living mycelial network—one that shares knowledge, redistributes resources, and grows the regenerative infrastructure our future demands.

Now is the time. Let’s seed the future, together.

**The Origins of Flow Funding**

Flow Funding is a community-led, trust-based approach to philanthropy—one expression of a practice that is ancient and cross-cultural, rooted in reciprocity and care. Marion Rockefeller Weber introduced the term “Flow Funding” to describe a trust-based approach to giving—one that reduces bureaucracy and allows resources to move more freely. Instead of requiring lengthy applications, she entrusted changemakers already making a difference to step into the role of philanthropist and direct funds where they saw the greatest potential for positive impact.

Marion started practicing this approach to giving after years of reading grant applications from people she didn’t know \- knowing that many wouldn’t receive funding. She grew disillusioned with the lack of relationality in traditional philanthropy, and longed for a more human and effective way to move resources. Trusting her intuition, she launched her first Flow Fund in the early 90s, entrusting 8 visionaries to $20k per year for 3 years to give away in service of their communities. They were asked not to fund their own projects and to share their experiences after serving as a “Flow Funder” \- answering the questions: What moved you? What inspired you? What challenged you? What surprised you?

This simple but transformative model prioritized trust over bureaucracy and catalyzed a network of people moving money with care and in response to their needs of their communities and ecosystems.

Marion has since guided and supported many other groups in adopting Flow Funding, seeding a growing field of relational, community-led giving. This playbook carries her legacy forward.

**About Kinship Earth**

Kinship Earth was founded in 2021 by Susan Davis Moora, Walter Moora, and Stephen L. Gomes, Ph.D., to reignite the KINS Innovation Network. KINS stands for Key Innovator **Network** Strategy \- a model for values-aligned collaboration and systems change. Kinship Earth started as a space to reconnect the KINS networks through online events featuring KINS members who would offer education and facilitate shared learning opportunities \- with the key themes being ecological, cultural, and economic regeneration.

In 2024, Kinship Earth adopted Flow Funding as its central practice, and key way to addres the challenges being faced by our world today \- aligning with the model created by Marion Rockefeller Weber. Flow Funding became a way for Kinship Earth to move money directly to trusted grassroots leaders—without applications or complex reporting requirements.

Kinship Earth is also embracing **Bioregional Flow Funding**: a place-based approach to resource distribution in partnership with locally rooted organizing groups.

In **October 2024**, Kinship Earth deployed its first round of Flow Funding grants to individual changemakers, 501(c)(3) organizations practicing Flow Funding, and 501(c)(3)s who for the first time practiced Flow Funding with the grants Kinship Earth gave them. In **February 2025**, Kinship Earth directed additional funds to bioregional organizers in the **Greater Tkaronto Bioregion** in and around Toronto, Canada.

A **Community of Practice** was launched to support ongoing learning and connection among Flow Funders, donors, team members, board members, and advisors.

Kinship Earth’s funding supports grassroots efforts across six interconnected focus areas:

* Regeneration of natural systems  
* Indigenous rights and land rematriation  
* Sovereign food systems and housing security  
* Social justice and economic equity  
* Disaster preparedness and relief  
* Advancements in human and ecosystem health  
* Healing arts and culture

Donors are invited to share their preferences if they wish to support a specific bioregion, an impact area, or both. If they already have trusted relationships with grassroots leaders, they’re encouraged to give directly. If not, Kinship Earth can help identify aligned local changemakers and grassroots organizations to flow funds to. Later in this playbook, we’ll outline the tax and regulatory differences between deploying “Flow Funds” through a 501(c)(3) vs. directly to individuals.

Kinship Earth is still young—actively learning, experimenting, and sharing what has been most useful. This playbook is an offering to the wider ecosystem of people building regenerative, community-led futures.

We welcome you into this evolving practice. 

### **2\. THE FOUNDATIONS: BIOREGIONALISM & FLOW FUNDING**

Before diving into tools and case studies, we’ll center the foundational concepts that shape this playbook: bioregionalism and Flow Funding. These two frameworks can work beautifully together—and they can also present tensions that we’ll address shortly.

**Bioregionalism**

Bioregionalism is a framework for organizing human activity in alignment with natural systems (e.g. watersheds) and the cultural heritage and identity of place. It calls us to recognize ecological boundaries, work with the land, and reconnect with the people, stories, and ecosystems that shape the places we call home.

It involves asking:

* What ecosystems support us?

* Who has cared for this place before us, and who is doing so now?

* How can we coordinate across sectors to heal and regenerate what has been damaged?

Bioregional organizing brings together diverse local people—deeply rooted in land and community—to co-create shared visions for regenerative futures. It catalyzes collaborations that address root causes across ecological, social, and economic dimensions. It calls for listening to quieter and historically underrepresented voices, and for honoring a balance of archetypal energies in how we show up—integrating what’s often called the “feminine” (deep listening, intuition, receptivity, and connection to the living world) with the “masculine” (structure, direction, and strategic action). These ways of being live in all of us, and both are essential for regenerating our communities and ecosystems.

The modern bioregional movement has strong roots in Cascadia, where in the 1970s and 80s, ecological thinkers, back-to-the-land activists, and community organizers began naming bioregions and exploring decentralized ways of living in alignment with nature. They convened Bioregional Congresses, created maps, launched learning circles, and envisioned self-organizing networks across watersheds. The first North American Bioregional Congress in 1984, inspired by Peter Berg and the Planet Drum Foundation, marked a key milestone. (ADD LINK TO MORE INFO) Since then, bioregionalism has taken many forms—from permaculture and watershed councils to resilience hubs and place-based learning networks.

While Cascadia helped crystallize the bioregional framework, the practice itself draws from much older traditions. For millennia, Indigenous peoples have stewarded their lands through relational governance—gathering without today’s political or economic barriers to care for community and ecosystem alike. Governance structures were fluid and responsive. In some matrilineal societies, like the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, women held formal authority over land, family, and leadership appointments, while men stepped into visible roles during crises—guided by the counsel of clan mothers. Across many cultures, leadership shifted seasonally: women often led during times of peace and abundance; men took action-oriented roles in times of hardship—while grounded in collective accountability. These systems were built on belonging, reciprocity, and shared responsibility for place. ADD LINK TO MORE INFO

Today, bioregionalism is experiencing a resurgence. Communities in Europe, South Asia, North America, and beyond are reviving bioregional frameworks to support ecosystem restoration, cultural revitalization, and grassroots self-determination. Initiatives like the Bioregional Weaving Labs, Pollinate Now, and Regenerate Cascadia reflect this shift—building regional funding ecosystems, fostering inter-community collaborations, and weaving traditional ecological knowledge with emerging regenerative practices.. ADD LINKS TO MORE INFO

Not everyone uses the word *bioregionalism*, but its core principles—rootedness, reciprocity, ecological alignment, and cross bioregion coordination—are echoed in place-based movements around the world. This language helps us find each other and organize—but the practice matters more than the name, “bioregion” and we have to be mindful not to exclude those who aren’t using or familiar with “bioregional” terminology.

This leads us to Flow Funding, which can intersect powerfully with bioregionalism. 

**Flow Funding**

Designed to be streamlined, agile, and relational, Flow Funding removes bureaucratic barriers and shifts decision-making power to those closest to the work—trusted grassroots leaders and organizers who are deeply rooted in place. It gives them the autonomy to decide how best to support their communities and ecosystems, based on lived experience, relationships, and emergent needs.

Flow Funders are not required to submit grant applications, and reporting is designed to be accessible and low burden. 

At Kinship Earth, Flow Funders are asked to reflect on their experience at the end of their 1 year term serving. We ask the questions Marion Rockefeller Weber asked of those whom she gave Flow Funding grants, noted above.

We also invite our Flow Funders to join a Community of Practice where all involved in the journey of flowing the funds including our donors are invited to collectively learn and grow together. 

Where traditional philanthropy can be top-down and slow, Flow Funding is:

* **Participatory:** Resources are stewarded by those directly engaged in community and ecological care  
* **Unrestricted:** Funds can be used however recipients determine is most impactful (in Kinship Earth’s case, we request that our Flow Funders deploy funds in ways that align with our impact focus noted above. ADD HERE  
* **Responsive:** Capital can move quickly without multiple layers of approval vs. having to stick to a plan that was shared in an application submitted months ago 

Flow Funding works especially well when a trusted individual or small group is given full autonomy to allocate funds based on lived experience and community relationships. In these cases, the “flow” is unimpeded—allowing for timely support to where it’s needed while incentivizing transparent, bottom up collaboration to solve local challenges

As this movement grows, we envision a future in which grassroots coalitions and bioregional leaders are resourced through trust—strengthening community ecosystems from within.

We’re also creating opportunities for Flow Funds to be allocated as a part of **Bioregional Congresses**. Initiatives like the **Planetary Party** are helping bring this vision to life. We’ll share more on that in a later section.

**The intersection of Bioregionalism and Flow Funding \-**

Flow Funding excels when capital needs to move quickly and with minimal friction. Bioregional congressing and collective decision-making emphasize inclusivity, collective decision making, cross sector  coordination and long-term alignment. This depth of engagement can slow down resource deployment timelines—but it can also create resilient , community-shaped, and context driven solutions.

In many cases, Flow Funding shines when a single trusted person has the autonomy to distribute funds based on deep relationships and real-time needs. In other cases, Flow Funding can be incredibly powerful when held by a group—especially one that has practiced shared governance, is rooted in bioregional vision, and is deeply attuned to the leaders and groups actively doing work in service of their bioregions.

At Kinship Earth, we honor both ends of this spectrum, and Flow Funds to individual changemakers and bioregional organizing groups. 

Here are some tools and resources created to support both individual and collective decision-making within bioregions: RESOURCES / LINKS HERE

This playbook emphasizes a bioregional approach to Flow Funding, and resources to support launching a **Bioregional Flow Fund**. If you’re interested, the starting point is orientation—deeply tuning in to the place, people, and needs of your home bioregion. The next section offers tools to support that process.

### **3\. ORIENTING TO YOUR PLACE**

*Before launching a Bioregional Flow Fund, the first step is to listen and feel into the needs of your bioregion. This section offers reflective tools to support deep orientation—both to place and to the people who are already stewarding change where you are.*

**What Is a Bioregion, Really?**

A bioregion is the interwoven story of land, life, and community. It includes the forests, rivers, fungi, weather patterns, foodways, migrations, languages, economies, and cultures that give a place its distinct identity. It also includes the historical and ongoing relationships people hold with place—both ancestral and contemporary.

Orienting to your bioregion means understanding:

* Who has shaped the land—and who has been displaced from it?

* What stories are held in the soil, water, and collective memory?

* Who is already doing the work of regeneration, care, and resistance?

**🌀 Guiding Questions**

The below prompts can support individual or group reflection as well as serve as conversation starters:

* **Ecological & Cultural Landscape**

  * What watersheds, foodsheds, or ecoregions define this place?

  * What seasonal cycles or species are central to life here?

  * What are the original languages of this land?

* **Existing Networks & Efforts**

  * Who is currently organizing for regeneration or justice here?

  * What land projects, mutual aid groups, Indigenous nations, or place-based networks exist?

  * Who are the trusted connectors and storytellers in this bioregion?

* **Needs, Gaps, and Leverage Points**

  * Where are resources flowing—and where are they not?

  * What local needs are unmet because of funding, policy, or capacity barriers?

  * What communities are most impacted and least resourced?

* **Vision & Readiness**

  * What’s calling you (or your group) to steward this work?

  * What values must guide how you operate?

  * What kind of Flow Fund or organizing structure would truly serve this place?

**Mapping Exercise (Suggested Format)**

Create a shared visual map to support your group’s sense-making. You might use:

* Large paper, sticky notes, or butcher paper

* An online whiteboard (e.g., Miro, MURAL)

* A spreadsheet to inventory networks, partners, and existing funds

* A physical or digital map of your bioregion to mark relationships, resources, and gaps

Include:

* Key ecological features (watersheds, habitats, seasonal patterns)

* Grassroots groups, orgs, or leaders doing aligned work

* Local funders or philanthropic allies

* Sites of extraction, harm, or contested development

* Places where community connection or ecological healing is already underway

### **4\. CREATING YOUR FLOW FUND**

*This section offers tools and examples to help you design and activate a Flow Fund that reflects the needs, values, and relationships in your bioregion.*

There is no single model for Flow Funding. Many organizations practice it in ways that reflect their own values, communities, and contexts. 

Kinship Earth has learned from and been inspired by these diverse approaches—and is grateful for the guidance and innovation others have contributed to this evolving field. REFERENCE FLOW FUNDING ORGS WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS GUIDE

#### 

#### **Step-by-Step Design Prompts**

We invite you to use the following guiding questions to begin shaping your own Flow Fund design:

* **Purpose & Values**

  * What’s the intention behind this fund?  
  * What values will guide how decisions are made?  
  * Who is this fund meant to support, and how?

* **Structure & Scope**

  * How are Flow Funders selected? By what criteria? Who will select the first round?   
  * Will you invite your Flow Funders to make recommendations on who could serve as a Flow Funder after their term?   
  * What is the goal for how much funding will flow, and in what time frame?

* **People & Roles**

  * Who are the advisors, connectors, or culture liaisons that need to be involved?

  * What support—legal, financial, or relational—would be needed to move resources effectively and ethically? e.g.   
    * Fiscal sponsorship if you don’t have 501c3 status yet  
    * Accounting and budgeting support / tracking the flow of funds  
    * Relational support like trusted advisors who are deeply embedded in the communities you're aiming to serve and can support communication, cultural translation, and accountability between funders and recipients.  
* **Agreements & Alignment**

  * What shared agreements or principles will guide the work?  
  * How will decisions be made? Individually? Collectively? Through community input?  
  * What feedback, reflection, or stories will be gathered from recipients?

These tools were finalized for use at the time they were created, but they’re living resources. We encourage you to adapt the language to fit your context, and we welcome feedback as we all continue to learn and evolve this work together.

**Contributions from Other Flow Funding Orgs**

We’ve also included tools and examples shared by other practitioners in the field. These offer a range of expressions of Flow Funding:

* **Regenerosity**: (ADD INFO \+ Resources, Templates, Etc. provided)  
* **Be The Earth Foundation**: (ADD INFO \+ “)  
* **The Fountain**: (ADD INFO \+ “)  
* **One Small Planet**  
* **Gitcoin**  
* **Big Green DAO**  
* 

**Tips for Getting Started**

* Build trust slowly and transparently. Regular check-ins with your Flow Funders are key, and often more accessible than formal reporting requirements.

* Don’t over-design before engaging your community. Let structure emerge through relationship.

* Be clear about expectations with Flow Funders and your board.

* Celebrate as you go. This is heart work.

* 

### **5\. GOVERNANCE & DECISION-MAKING MODELS**

*Flow Funding thrives when grounded in clarity, mutual respect, and shared responsibility. This section explores a spectrum of governance approaches to help you build a structure for decision making that reflects your values and community context.*

Whether you’re creating a small, nimble Flow Fund or integrating Flow Funding into a larger bioregional effort, or foundation, this section will help you design ways to make decisions and hold agreements that feel just, adaptive, and transparent.

**Roles & Responsibilities**

Consider the following roles in your governance design:

* **Flow Funders:** Individuals entrusted to distribute resources, and honored for their wisdom.

* **Stewarding Circle (what Kinship Earth calls “Flow Fund Advisors”):** A group that helps guide the values and direction of the Flow Fund (can rotate or evolve)

* **Cultural Keepers / Liaisons:** Individuals who help ensure the fund remains culturally responsive, inclusive, and grounded in right relationship with place. They are sometimes hired by Flow Funding organizations to support communication between the organization’s leadership and grantees—particularly where there may be language barriers or cultural differences. By serving as a bridge, they can reduce the administrative burden on grantees and help build deeper trust and understanding across all parties.

* **Support Coordinator:** A person or team offering logistical, communications, or relational support (in Kinship Earth’s case, this is what our Executive Director does)

Kinship Earth uses lightweight agreements, email check-ins, seasonal Communities of Practice meetings on Zoom, 1-1 calls between Flow Funders and our Executive Director as needed, and reflective prompts to collect stories of impact from our Flow Funders. 

## **Choosing How Decisions Are Made**

When deploying Flow Funds, it’s essential to determine how funding decisions will be made. 

There’s no one “right” approach. Some situations call for shared deliberation and inclusive processes, while others require swift action. It’s important to assess what the moment calls for—and to stay flexible. For example, in times of urgency—such as natural disasters, health crises, or evictions—consensus-building can be too slow. In these cases, we recommend nominating a trusted individual or small team to make funding decisions on behalf of the group. It’s important that these stewards are deeply rooted in the bioregion and trusted to act with integrity and care. (Example: check out this pilot that we explored in 2016 with Start Network: https://startnetwork.org/learn-change/news-and-blogs/blockchain-pilot-tests-innovative-solution-collaboration-accountability-and) 

**Individual vs. Collective Decision-Making**

Group decision-making (e.g., through voting, consensus or consent-based decision making) can strengthen alignment, equity, and collaboration. 

**Decision-Making Approaches to Consider:**

You might want to explore one or a combination of the following models:

* **Consensus or Consent-Based Processes**  
  All group members agree (consensus), or no one has strong objections (consent), before moving forward. These processes build cohesion and equity but require time and facilitation. *Learn more:* [Sociocracy for All](https://www.sociocracyforall.org), The Consent Principle – Sociocracy 3.0

* **Community Voting or Quadratic Voting**  
  Participants express preferences by allocating votes or credits across proposals. Quadratic voting allows people to weigh their priorities more expressively. *Learn more:* RadicalxChange: Quadratic Voting, [Gitcoin’s Quadratic Funding Model](https://wtfisqf.com/)  
  * Add info about [Conviction Voting](https://blog.giveth.io/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475)

* **🔁 Rotating Stewardship**  
   A small team of decision-makers rotates on a regular basis (e.g., seasonally or annually). This distributes leadership over time and helps prevent burnout or power centralization.

  * *Example:* Some Indigenous-inspired councils, co-ops, and community land trusts apply seasonal or rotating leadership rooted in relational trust.

* **Informal Dialogue \+ Reflection Check-Ins**  
  Especially for smaller or close-knit groups, funding decisions may arise through open conversation, reflection, and intuition. These processes are relational, adaptable, and can reflect seasonal rhythms or group dynamics. *Helpful resource:* [The Art of Hosting](https://www.artofhosting.org/) offers tools for emergent facilitation and participatory conversation design.

* **DAO-Inspired Governance Tools**  
  Some bioregional groups are experimenting with decentralized decision-making platforms, inspired by DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). Tools like [Hypha](https://hypha.earth/) and [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) allow for transparent voting, proposal tracking, role assignment, and shared treasury management. *Learn more:* RESOURCE

**Other Contributed Models**

To show the diversity of practice, we’ve included governance approaches from other Flow Funds and bioregional organizing groups:

* **The BioFi Project and its Bioregional Finance Facilities**: Fractal, nested governance models for bioregional finance networks

* **MycoFi**: Role-based cooperative governance through digital infrastructure

Each of these models offers different pathways based on the context and culture they emerge from.

**Tips for Co-Creating Governance**

* Keep it light. Governance doesn’t have to mean paperwork—it means relationships and clarity.

* Share power with intention. Who has voice and who decides should be guided by your values.

* Invite reflection. What worked this round? What felt sticky? What might evolve next time?

* Design for accountability without shame. Let feedback loops support growth, not punishment.

Governance is iterative, and there’s no right way. Trust, clarity, and alignment are key to getting started, and evolving as you go.  

###  

### **6\. CASE STUDIES & STORIES**

*This section highlights real-world examples that offer insight, inspiration, and tangible proof that Flow Funding is working.*

These stories are snapshots of creativity, trust, and collaboration. Each one reflects different bioregional contexts, values, and structures—and collectively, they help illustrate the evolving field of community-driven resource flow.

We’ve organized this section to include:

* Kinship Earth’s initial Flow Funder reports (anonymous)   
* Stories from other Flow Funding organizations   
* An open invitation for you to share your own case study or experience

**Kinship Earth: Learning Through Doing**

Kinship Earth launched its first rounds of Flow Funds by partnering with trusted grassroots advisors \-  local leaders who represent the communities we aim to serve and who are actively working to address the challenges their local communities are facing. These advisors have also supported us in shaping our Flow Funding agreements—helping to cultivate the culture, values, and guiding principles that define how we collaborate and show up in this work. You can view our agreements [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M5h2hlmjLEcaJDtbuqcgJbtq0jiboHu73Y1GP99y_3w/edit?usp=sharing). 

Key learnings so far:

* Simplicity invites action—light structure, clear intent, and trusted relationships.  
* Flow Funders often develop their own intuitive approaches to giving—this autonomy is part of the magic, inviting creativity and allowing emergence to guide the process.  
* Stories from recipients are just as powerful as metrics.

*This section offers strategies, insights, and examples for resourcing your Flow Fund and bioregional organizing work in values-aligned ways.*

While Flow Funding is about *trusting where money goes*, it also invites us to examine *how* money comes in. Traditional philanthropic systems often come with strings, rigid expectations, and bureaucratic burdens that can stifle the flexibility and relationship-centered nature of Flow Funding.

This section offers approaches for:

* Raising unrestricted or trust-based capital

* Framing your work in a way that invites deep alignment

* Diversifying funding pathways—including individual donors, DAFs, events, family offices, pooled funds, and creative economies

**Kinship Earth’s Approach to Fundraising**

As a young organization, Kinship Earth has:

* Partnered with aligned donors and foundations who believe in trust-based giving

* Framed Flow Funding as a model that fills traditional philanthropy gaps

* Offering flexible reporting and invitations to learn together rather than asking for outcomes in advance

* Using events and storytelling to build visibility and invite participation

Included in this playbook:

* Sample one-pager for fundraising

* Template email for inviting a funder to support Flow Funding

* Suggested language for donor engagement and fund design transparency

**Other Strategies in Use**

**1\. Planetary Parties & Event-Based Fundraising**  
The Planetary Party concept involves donors and others directly witnessing the power of grassroots leaders making decisions together around resource flow. The Planetary Party concept also involves:

* Permaculture action

* Storytelling and celebration

* Bioregional congress-style fund allocation

**2\. Community  / Member Contributions**  
Pooled funding models where those within a community contribute a small, recurring gift (time, money, or skill) to resource collective needs.

**3\. Pooled Funds & Fiscal Sponsorship**  
Collaborating with a fiscal sponsor allows small Flow Funds to access tax-deductible giving channels and administrative support. Some use pooled donor-advised funds to manage and redistribute resources collectively.

**4\. Gifts Outside Traditional Structures**  
Some Flow Funds are resourced through private individuals, crypto contributions, or inheritance redistribution. Others use regenerative currencies and locally grounded economic models (e.g. SEEDS, timebanks). 

**Principles for Fundraising in Alignment**

* **Lead with relationship**—fundraising is a continuation of trust-building

* **Be transparent**—clarity creates ease and trust for funders and Flow Funders alike

* **Value your time**—be honest about capacity, boundaries, and what support looks like

* **Make it easy to give** — Create multiple, flexible pathways for donors to contribute and stay connected. Donors can give directly to individuals or groups they already know and trust, or we can help connect them with aligned bioregional organizers doing impactful work on the ground.   
  * For Example, through our partnership with the Earth Regeneration Fund and locally rooted groups, we’re building pathways for funds to flow directly into bioregions—resourcing place-based efforts quickly, relationally, and with care. *For example, donors can contribute to the [Earth Regeneration Fund](https://www.bioregionalearth.org/fund/earth-regeneration-fund), donate to bioregional organizing groups participating in that ecosystem directly, or they can give to Kinship Earth to help sustain the broader coordination and scaling of this work.*


* **Let the story lead**—impact is best communicated through authentic narrative

### 

### **9\. MONITORING, STORYTELLING & SENSING IMPACT**

*How do we know if it’s working? How do we share what’s shifting—without replicating extractive application processes and extensive reporting requirements that make grants inaccessible? This section offers principles, tools, and examples for sensing and communicating impact in ways that are authentic, relational, and regenerative.*

**Why Story Matters More Than Metrics**

Traditional philanthropy often demands detailed reports, complex evaluation frameworks, and quantified outcomes. These metrics can’t always reflect the essence of transformation—especially in grassroots, relational, and bioregional work.

Flow Funding and bioregional organizing call for a different kind of accountability \- reflection, deepening trust, and sharing stories of change.

**Principles for Sensing Impact**

* **Stories are a form of data** – What people say, feel, and experience is valid and valuable.  
* **Participatory** – Those closest to the work define what success means.  
* **Shared Learning For All Involved** – Reflection is a gift when it cultivates growth amongst the giver, the recipient, and the team or organization that is serving as a vessel for funds to flow.   
* **Identify Patterns** – What signals are emerging? What’s shifting over time?

**What You Might Reflect On vs. “Report”**

Offer Flow Funders and grantees optional prompts like:

* What did this funding allow you to do that wouldn’t have happened otherwise?

* What shifted in your community, your relationships, or the land you steward?

* What felt most impactful? What surprised you?

* What support (beyond money) would help you keep going?

These reflections can take many forms:

* Voice memos

* Photos with short captions

* Handwritten letters

* Art, poetry, video

* Short notes or emails

* Group reflections shared in community

**Participatory MRV & Community Mapping**

In bioregional organizing, sensing impact can also include:

* Community storytelling events

* Bioregional mapping of funded projects

* Visual “before and after” documentation

* Ecosystem health indicators (co-created by the community)

* Network diagrams to show relational growth

The goal is not to prove—but to witness. To track the ripple effects of resourcing trust, care, and action.

“To tell the story is to honor the transformation. To reflect together is to grow the field.”

### **10\. ONGOING COMMUNITY & FUTURE COLLABORATION**

*This playbook is only one part of a larger movement. As you begin—or continue—your journey with Flow Funding and bioregional organizing, know that here is an active, evolving community creating opportunities for learning, sharing, and growing.*

**A Living, Learning Ecosystem**

Flow Funding and bioregional organizing are living practices that grow through experimentation, relationship, and iteration. This playbook is meant to be a launchpad—but the deeper work happens in community.

That’s why we’re cultivating spaces where you can:

* Connect with others who are launching or sustaining Flow Funds

* Ask questions and share tools

* Join thematic learning sessions and collaborative work circles

* Celebrate your wins and process your challenges

   
**Ways to Stay Connected**

**Kinship Earth Learning Circles & Discord**  
Join our online community space to meet others practicing Flow Funding and bioregional organizing. We host:

* Monthly learning circles featuring rotating themes

* Open co-working sessions and peer exchange

* A shared folder of templates, agreements, and fund designs

* Opportunities to co-create future versions of this playbook

**Upcoming Events & Gatherings**  
We often collaborate with other bioregional networks to host immersive experiences, online workshops, and bioregional congress-style convenings. These are opportunities to:

* Connect across bioregions

* Share learning in real time

* Explore governance, fundraising, and storytelling methods

* Strengthen solidarity and shared vision

**Contribute to the Next Edition**  
This playbook will continue to evolve. We invite you to:

* **Add your Flow Fund or project to our bioregional map**

* **Join a peer learning circle or offer to host one**

* **Contribute to the ecosystem directory**

* **Sign up to receive updates on new tools, stories, and gatherings**

The work of flowing capital, healing place, and restoring relationship is ancient and emergent. This is a global movement that’s rooted in the local.

Thank you for being here. Thank you for helping this field grow.

### **CLOSING REFLECTION**

*There is no one path or model to replicate. No one “right” way to flow resources or steward a bioregion, as every community, town, bioregion is uniquely different \- with its own history, culture, practices, agreements, and set of challenges. The hope is that groups within a bioregion become skilled at sharing resources and knowledge—and that entire bioregions do the same—as a powerful pathway to planetary regeneration.*

In this movement we’re being asked to trust one another more than we trust the systems we’ve inherited. We’re being asked to return to the intelligence of place—and to the possibility that people, when given the tools and support, will do what is needed with care and creativity.

We hope this playbook has given you something to work with—whether it’s a structure to adapt, a question to sit with, a community to join, or insights and stories to contribute.

As this field evolves, the only way we get better is together.
