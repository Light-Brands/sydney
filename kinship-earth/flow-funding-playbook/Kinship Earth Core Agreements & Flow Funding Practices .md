* Drive action through mindfulness and cultural revitalization.  
* Intentionally decolonize philanthropy.  
* Recognize and challenge power dynamics and oppressive systems.

#### **3\. Community Engagement & Mutual Support**

* Emphasize vulnerability, deep listening, and heart-sharing.  
* Rotate facilitation roles and encourage shared leadership.  
* Build authentic relationships and foster connection with Earth.

#### **4\. Communication & Trust**

* Be attuned to cultural nuance and equity in all engagements.

#### **6\. Nature-First Philosophy**

* Give nature a voice in decision-making (e.g., "a tree at the table").  
* Make time for connection with nature.  
* Center Indigenous voices and ecological wisdom.

#### **7\. Restorative Justice & Feedback Loops**

* Resolve conflict using restorative practices and non-violent dialogue.

* Pause to reflect on misalignment and use ecological metaphors for problem-solving.

#### **9\. Inclusive Decision-Making & Role Rotation**

* Embrace a range of decision-making models (e.g., consensus, consent, rotating stewardship).  
* In times of urgency or crisis, elect a trusted individual to make funding decisions on behalf of the group.  
* DAOs and other decentralized models may be explored for transparent governance.

#### **10\. Narrative Impact Measurement**

* Prioritize qualitative storytelling over quantitative reporting.  
* Invite Flow Funders and recipients to share what inspired, challenged, moved, and surprised them.  
* Integrate comprehensive, participatory design science into program evaluation.
