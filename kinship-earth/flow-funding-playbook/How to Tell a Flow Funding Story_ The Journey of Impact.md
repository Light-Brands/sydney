### **How to Tell a Flow Funding Story: The Journey of Impact**

Flow Funding is more than a philanthropic model—it’s a journey of trust, care, and responsiveness. As Flow Funders, you are invited to move money with deep intention, intuition, and integrity. The stories that emerge from this process are powerful: they help illuminate the impact of this approach, inspire future funders, and honor the communities and ecosystems being resourced.

This guide is an invitation to reflect on and share your Flow Funding experience. It does not require polished writing or formal reporting. Instead, it centers honesty, vulnerability, and learning.

### **Core Reflection Questions**

These four guiding questions were first offered by Marion Rockefeller Weber, who pioneered the Flow Funding model. We encourage each Flow Funder to reflect on them as a way of telling the story of their journey:

* **What inspired you?**  
  What stories, people, or moments affirmed your belief in this work?  
* **What moved you?**  
  What touched your heart? What experiences stayed with you?  
* **What surprised you?**  
  What unfolded differently than you expected? What shifted your perspective?  
* **What challenged you?**  
  What questions arose for you? What was difficult to navigate?

You are welcome to share responses to each individually, or weave them together in a narrative or creative format (e.g., prose, video, audio, poetry).

### **Additional Prompts (Optional)**

If helpful, here are some other angles you might explore:

* What did you learn about your bioregion or community?  
* How did you build trust or deepen relationships through this process?  
* What were some of the impacts—tangible or intangible—you witnessed?  
* What are you curious about now, or excited to explore next?  
* What advice would you offer to someone stepping into this role?

### **Sharing Your Story**

Kinship Earth invites Flow Funders to share their stories in video format, or via writing, voice notes, or any medium that feels natural. **We especially encourage video submissions** as video is often the most powerful format for evoking the feeling and spirit of what transpired.

These stories:

* Help donors and partners understand the depth and nuance of this work  
* Contribute to a collective library of lived experience  
* Can be used (with your permission) to inspire others and support broader cultural shifts in philanthropy

Stories are requested within 12 months of the Flow Funder’s start date, but they can be shared at any time throughout the year.

### **Optional Follow-Up**

If you’d like, you can schedule a one-on-one reflection session with Kinship Earth’s Executive Director to explore your journey in dialogue. We’re always learning from one another.

Thank you for being part of this movement.
