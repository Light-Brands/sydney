***Flow Funder Role & Responsibilities***

Welcome to [Kinship Earth](https://www.kinshipearth.org/)\! 

**Background:**

Kinship Earth was created to empower trusted grassroots leaders to distribute resources to individuals making a positive impact in their communities.

The concept of Flow Funding was pioneered in 1991 by Marion Rockefeller Weber, who was sickened by the complex and time-consuming processes involved in giving away her money. She envisioned a simpler, more direct approach that bypassed grant applications and reporting \- what often limits grassroots organizers' access to resources. Marion selected 8 visionary leaders she trusted and provided each with $20,000 annually for three years. They were asked to distribute the funds to those they intuitively believed would make the greatest impact with these resources, and in whatever quantities they chose. This approach was so successful that it has been adopted by many charities around the world.

One of Kinship Earth's founders, [Susan Davis Moora](https://www.kinshipearth.org/leadership), was an early recipient of Marion’s Flow Funds. Inspired by this method, Susan and the team at Kinship Earth have embraced this approach to philanthropy and plan to expand its reach globally.

Agreements We Strive To Uphold While Working Together:

*Community Engagement & Mutual Support:*  
Cultivate mutual support and prioritize relationship-building with each other and Earth.

Embrace alternative ways of creating and sharing, focusing on equity and inclusivity in grant-making and reporting.

*Observation & Reflection:*  
Regularly reflect on changes in land, water, and community. Consider nature’s perspective before making significant Flow Fund program changes.

*Conflict Resolution:*  
Approach conflicts with self-reflection and group learning, exercise non-violent communication.

Parameters for Flowing Resources: 

The only requirements are that you give the funds you receive from Kinship Earth to others vs. to your own projects or those of your immediate family members. Kinship Earth will make exceptions as appropriate.

* **For 501(c)(3) Organizations Flowing Funds:** 501c3s receive funds from Kinship Earth to redistribute as they see fit. The end recipients can be either other 501(c)(3) organizations or individuals, provided that the use of funds are charitable and educational in nature and documented.   
* **For Individuals Flowing Funds:** Individuals flowing funds are acting as “agents” of Kinship Earth, representing the organization in identifying and flowing resources to aligned 501(c)(3) organizations (or individuals with 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship) to receive the funds.

Share Your Stories: 

We ask that you share your impact stories, which will be used on our website and / or social media channels to support our fundraising efforts. (The end recipients of Flow Funds are invited to share their stories, too, if they’d like, but this is not a requirement). 

All forms of media are accepted, however 3-5 minutes videos are preferred.  (Note: We will share resources on how to tell impact stories). 

We will also ask you to briefly answer the following questions about your experience as a Flow Funder after your 1-year term:

* Who did you give funds to and why?  
* As a part of practicing Flow Funding:   
  * What inspired you?   
  * What surprised you?   
  * What challenged you?   
  * What moved you?

Confidentiality: 

To protect your privacy and to avoid the possibility of your being solicited for funds, we recommend refraining from broadly sharing your role as a Flow Funder. It is up to your discretion as to how broadly you share this information. 

Meetings: 

You will be invited to several Zoom meetings throughout your 1-year term, including:

* A 1-on-1 onboarding call with our Executive Director (\~30 minutes or longer if needed)  
  * Attending this 1-1 onboarding meeting is a requirement  
* A group onboarding call (optional but encouraged, \~1-1.5 hours)  
* Seasonal Community of Practice Gatherings on Zoom  (4 Total, every 3 months, \~1-1.5 hours each)   
  * If you cannot make a gathering, we require that you check-in with our Executive Director via a 1-1 Zoom call or email 

**How Receiving & Donating Grant Money Could Affect Your Taxes (for U.S. Citizens / Orgs)**

***Note:** U.S. laws may change. It is important to seek your own advice regarding how you file your taxes.*

**Pass-Through Funds for Charitable Distribution:**

When you receive a Flow Fund grant, it is considered taxable income when it is deposited into your bank account. However, since these funds are to be donated for charitable or educational purposes, the donation offsets any taxes owed on the income.

**Income & Offset Through Charitable Giving:**

Because grant funds are categorized as income, they must be reported on your tax return. However, when you distribute them as donations within the same tax year, this expense offsets the taxable amount, therefore eliminating tax liability.

**Important Timing Note:**

* If you receive funds in **2024** but do not distribute them until **2025**, the income must still be reported in 2024\. The charitable deduction for funds deployed in 2025 will reduce your 2025 tax liability but cannot retroactively offset 2024 taxes.  
* If you need funds to cover the tax burden in 2024, please let us know.

**No Need for Manual Deductions:**

All necessary tracking and documentation are handled by Kinship Earth, ensuring accurate records without extra administrative work on your part. Flow Funders are not required to submit bank statements—our process relies on your reports and our internal documentation to maintain compliance. This ensures that you can receive and distribute funds without additional bookkeeping burdens while still benefiting from the tax offset.
