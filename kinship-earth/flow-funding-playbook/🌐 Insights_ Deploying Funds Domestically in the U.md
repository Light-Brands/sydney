## **🌐 Insights: Deploying Funds Domestically in the U.S. vs. Internationally**

*(For U.S.-Based Flow Funds)*

---

### **Purpose**

This document offers key insights for **U.S.-based Flow Funds and Flow Funders** deploying resources both **within the United States** and **internationally**.

Because Kinship Earth is a U.S.-based foundation, this guidance reflects **U.S. legal and compliance requirements**. If your Flow Fund is based outside the U.S., please adapt these principles to your local regulations.

The goal is to help Flow Funders move money in ways that are **ethical, lawful, and relational** — ensuring generosity can flow freely while honoring our shared responsibility as stewards of resources.

### **1\. The Current Landscape of U.S. Philanthropy & Compliance**

The environment for philanthropy and charitable giving in the United States is shifting.

Recent years have brought increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies, reduced access to certain forms of federal funding, and greater risks for nonprofits using language or framing considered “political” — even when addressing social, racial, or environmental issues at their root.

Some organizations have lost or risked their tax-exempt status due to perceived advocacy or alignment with contested terms, while others face more stringent reporting obligations. As a result, **grassroots and mission-driven groups are having to adapt — becoming more creative, relational, and community-supported in how they sustain their work.**

At the same time, **traditional philanthropy is being challenged** for perpetuating the very inequities it seeks to solve — through centralized control, complex applications, and restrictive funding practices that limit autonomy and innovation at the local level.

**Flow Funding offers another way.**  
 It decentralizes decision-making, builds trust between donors and doers, and allows funds to flow with more agility and responsiveness.

Kinship Earth’s role includes **educating Donor Advised Funds (DAFs), family offices, and philanthropic institutions** on why and how to practice Flow Funding — encouraging them to move beyond compliance-driven giving toward **relational, trust-based funding** that centers community voice and systemic healing.

🌾 *In this evolving landscape, Flow Funding provides a bridge between wealth and wisdom — helping funders act with integrity and responsiveness in a time when creativity and trust are essential.*

### **2\. Domestic Giving (Within the United States)**

When **Flow Funding within the United States**, the process is generally simpler and requires fewer compliance steps — provided the Flow Fund itself is U.S.-based.

Even so, documentation, clarity of purpose, and alignment with charitable intent remain essential to uphold trust and transparency.

#### **Key Considerations**

* **Tax Status:** Funds may be disbursed to individuals, nonprofits, or unincorporated projects. When funds are given to individuals or informal groups, it’s important to clearly document the charitable intent — for public benefit rather than personal enrichment.

* **Fiscal Sponsorship:** If a recipient lacks 501(c)(3) status, consider partnering with a fiscal sponsor. This ensures accountability and may provide tax-deductible options for donors.

* **Reporting:** Use the Flow Funder Reporting Form to record each disbursement — amount, date, purpose, and brief outcomes or learnings.

* **State Regulations:** Some states may have unique reporting or charitable solicitation rules; confirm if applicable.

* **Relational Ethics:** Always prioritize transparency and shared understanding with recipients — communicate expectations and maintain open dialogue.

### **3\. International Giving**

When a **U.S.-based Flow Fund** disburses funds internationally, there are additional layers of compliance and context to consider.

Each country has its own laws governing how funds for **social, environmental, or charitable causes** can be received and used. These laws vary widely — from open and flexible frameworks to highly regulated systems requiring permits, tax registrations, or government approvals.

#### **Key Considerations**

* **Legal Context:**  
   Some countries treat incoming grants or donations as taxable income, while others require NGOs or individuals to register foreign gifts. Encourage recipients to check their local regulations and, if necessary, seek guidance from trusted advisors.

* **Currency and Transfer Logistics:**  
   Choose legal and transparent methods for sending funds (e.g., Wise, PayPal, international wire). Verify accessibility and cost-effectiveness on both sides.

* **Documentation:**  
   Record each international transfer — including recipient contact information, purpose, amount, and confirmation of receipt.

* **Exchange Rates and Fees:**  
   Factor in conversion rates and transfer costs so the recipient receives the intended amount.

* **Verification and Safety:**  
   Maintain direct communication with recipients, verify legitimacy, and confirm shared understanding of purpose and use of funds.

🪶 *Compliance ensures protection for both giver and receiver. Flow Funding is built on trust — and trust is strongest when paired with transparency and diligence.*
