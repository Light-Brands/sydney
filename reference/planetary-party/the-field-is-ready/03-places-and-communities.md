## A Quiet, Personal Connection

One of my most meaningful moments in Davos came through a quiet, personal connection. I met Moritz, who shared his healing journey - learning to listen to his body, to meditate and rest when needed, and to move at a pace that supports his health. This conversation was powerful medicine for me as I navigate my own health challenges. It helped me slow down and care for myself more intentionally throughout my WEF experience.

I was also moved learning about the tea ceremonies he was offering throughout WEF and the space he coordinated for people to land and rest. He shared his inspiring project with me as well - traveling by sailboat with a small curated group throughout China to explore tea, culture, healing, arts and experimental economies. I felt kinship with him.

## The Relational Edges

Many of the most resonant moments unfolded not on the main stages, but along the cultural and relational edges, including at:

- **The Sacred Shell** — A healing, meditation, music, and ceremony space focused on the elements, nervous-system regulation, and collective restoration

- **House of Trust** — Deep conversations about trust as infrastructure, especially in finance, governance, and community

- **Climate Hub** — Pragmatic, action-oriented climate coordination and regenerative infrastructure development

- **Future House** — Where I stayed, alongside successful entrepreneurs and visionaries exploring purpose beyond profit (Shoutout to Rachel Morrison and Jonathan Barry for inviting us into this amazing group who I now call family)

- **World Systemic Forum (WSF)** — Curated by [reState Foundation](https://restate.global/): attracting wealth holders and visionaries focused on systems change and healing, and where myself and my collaborators at Kinship Earth and the Planetary Party led an interactive and joy-infused "Funding Systems Change" workshop (including myself, Juan Carlos Kaiten, Eslerh Oreste, and Rachel Morrison, and we also got help from systems change-maker, Sarah Baxendell); Rachel and I did a brief recap reel sharing our experience at WSF

- **Marc Buckley's delegation spaces** — Which included Dina Baenninger, Paul Stamets, Dr. Pam Kryskow, Daniel Nicolai, and Alex Zagrebelny of R-Evolution and Ewya - where my colleagues and I had the honor of serving as their media team

- **Cooperative Futures Institute's events** — Hosted by Athena Aktipis and Joel Dietz, including the intimate breakfast they co-hosted with Anastasia Kalinina of ReState Foundation and the World Systemic Forum, and the "Surviving AI" comedy show they held in a swanky converted train car, featuring Shane Mauss

- **[UnDavos](https://www.undavos.com/) gatherings** — Where we offered media coverage + enjoyed their epic closing dance party

- **Musical events featuring Eslerh Oreste** — Invited to open and close with his live music (throat singing, flute, beat boxing, etc.), at times in collaboration with incredible rapper, Baba Brinkman

## Earth One Reconnections

Not surprisingly, I reconnected with individuals with whom I attended the Earth One Atlantic Crossing (11-day cruise / experiment) - a wild curation of funders, change-makers, artists, technologists, and visionaries. I remain curious about the outcomes of this gathering, besides my meeting impressive humans who are serving Earth and humanity.

## Surrender, Trust & Synchronicity

Throughout this event, the principles of surrendering, trusting, and attunement to synchronicities were constantly reinforced - as connections of collaboration and creativity seamlessly spawned and integrated into the overall purpose of attending. This is a state I am deeply harmonizing into my life and work, and it's the same state that's guiding The Planetary Party.
