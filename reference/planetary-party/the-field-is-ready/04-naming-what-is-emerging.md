## The Field Is Ready

The field is ready - not for new ideologies, centralized institutions, nor movements competing for attention - but for a living, cultural, bioregional coordination space to hold:

- The longing for meaning and coherence
- The desire for collaboration across ecosystems
- The need for regenerative capital flows
- The hunger for culture, celebration, and healing
- The urgency for real-world, place-based action

What myself and an ecosystem of visionaries around the world are calling: **The Planetary Party** - a way of being many of us are already embracing; gathering in joy and community to navigate forward together, through creativity, care, coordination, and collective action.

## Culture, Coordination & Capital

Alongside this cultural emergence, [Kinship Earth](https://www.kinshipearth.org/) is actively stewarding the financial infrastructure needed to support bioregional coordination in practice - through **Bioregional Flow Funding**: a trust-based approach to moving resources directly into the hands of place-based organizers and communities, and entrusting them to deploy those funds where they can make the greatest impact.

Together, these threads - culture, coordination, and capital - are beginning to weave into something coherent. Not a single organization or ideology, but a living pattern that is quietly taking shape across bioregions.

## The Planetary Party Is a New Myth

The Planetary Party is a new myth for humanity. It's a meme that's spreading through converging organizations, ceremonies, festivals, cultural spaces, and stories.

The Party is not owned by any one person or group. It is not a brand to control. It is a culture many of us are already embodying that says:

- We can heal the world through collective creation.
- We can regenerate through celebration.
- We can build coherence through trust and shared intention.
- We can make systems change feel alive, human, and meaningful.

It weaves existing, aligned movements together to form the rich soil from which meaningful local-to-global coordination and cooperation can grow.

**Anyone can host or participate in a Planetary Party. This is open-source at the level of culture and community.**

## The Planetary Party Protocol

At the same time, we are developing a **Planetary Party Protocol** - a living set of processes, practices, tools, products, and services to share successful practices, protocols and principles to help individuals and communities create "the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible," as Charles Eisenstein puts it.

## Inviting Co-Creation

For those who feel resonance with this direction, we are inviting co-creation.

Alongside the open, cultural expression of the Planetary Party, we are developing a shared onboarding and co-creation pathway - a relational container for people and communities who wish to integrate collective wisdom, coherent decision-making, and regenerative coordination together.

### The Third Attractor

This pathway is oriented toward what some describe as a **third attractor** - not a fixed blueprint for the future, but a living direction of travel that moves beyond collapse, on one hand, and, on the other hand, a centralized, extractive control method. The third attractor cultivates the capacities required to steward increasingly powerful tools, technologies, and resources with care, accountability, and integrity.

Within this container, participants are invited to:

- Align around shared values and intentions
- Learn together across disciplines, cultures, and bioregions
- Practice coherence and collective sensemaking
- Coordinate across bioregions and synergize efforts
- Contribute to the ongoing evolution of a living protocol - together

Rather than prescribing solutions, this co-creation space is designed to support emergence - creating the conditions for more regenerative, resilient, and life-affirming systems to take shape through relationship, practice, and shared learning.
