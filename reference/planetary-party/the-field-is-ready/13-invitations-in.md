If you feel resonance and want to explore what's emerging, here are a few ways to step in:

## Explore the Planetary Party

Express your interest in participating in the Planetary Party ecosystem - including guilds, collaborations, and upcoming calls.

## Learn & Sense Together

Express interest in joining upcoming LIVE learning sessions and conversations on Regenerative Capital Flows - including:

- Flow Funding and trust-based philanthropy
- Regenerative crypto / community currencies / digital assets
- Cooperative finance
- Green bonds
- Carbon and biodiversity credits
- Social impact investing
- Commitment pooling
- Other alternative financial tools
- Real-world case studies

## Bring Flow Funding to Your Bioregion

If you are part of a place-based organizing group, community, or network, explore what it would mean to launch a Bioregional Flow Fund where you live - supported by [Kinship Earth](https://www.kinshipearth.org/).

## Land-Based Co-Creation (Unified Sanctuaries)

If you feel called to land stewardship, regenerative community, and place-based experimentation, express interest in supporting or co-creating Unified Sanctuaries - a land-based project and living blueprint for collective stewardship in the Northeast.

## Supporting the Flow of Unrestricted Resources to Grassroots Change-makers

If you are in a position to resource this work, you are invited to support Kinship Earth's Bioregional Flow Funding efforts - moving capital directly into the hands of bioregional organizers and communities serving life, in partnership with The Planetary Party Ecosystem.
