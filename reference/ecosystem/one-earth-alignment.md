# One Earth Solutions Framework: Alignment with the Regenerative Ecosystem

**Source:** [One Earth Solutions Hub](https://www.oneearth.org/solutions/)

This document maps the One Earth solutions framework — 75+ climate solutions organized across three pillars, seven levers of change, and seven intersectional themes — against the four initiatives in Sydney's Regenerative Ecosystem. The purpose is to identify strategic alignment, shared language for funders and partners, and concrete opportunities to deepen the work.

## Overview of One Earth's Framework

One Earth organizes its solutions across **three pillars**:

1. **Energy Transition** — 100% renewable energy across power, heat, transport, and efficiency
2. **Nature Conservation** — Protect, restore, and connect 50% of Earth's lands and oceans
3. **Regenerative Agriculture** — Transform food systems through sustainable land management

These are activated through **seven levers of change**: philanthro-activism, nature/climate finance, policy & governance, science & technology, legal empowerment, community action, and education & culture.

And grounded in **seven intersectional themes**: gender equity, social justice, youth leadership, sustainable livelihoods, public health, water stewardship, and biological diversity.

## Pillar-by-Pillar Alignment

### 1. Energy Transition → Unified Sanctuaries + Permatours

| One Earth Solution Pathway | Direct Relevance |
|---|---|
| **Solar photovoltaic & renewable power** | Unified Sanctuaries' regenerative village design should integrate distributed solar and microgrids as part of its infrastructure — aligned with the open-source blueprint model for global replication |
| **Built environment efficiency** | Permatours' natural building workshops (cob, hempcrete, earthen construction) are a hands-on, community-scale implementation of One Earth's built environment efficiency solutions |
| **Renewable heat (geothermal, solar heat)** | Unified Sanctuaries' bathhouse and retreat center could pioneer renewable heat systems as a demonstration site |
| **Electric vehicles & transport** | Less direct, but bioregional organizing (Planetary Party) inherently reduces transport demand by localizing economies |

**Opportunity:** One Earth's energy transition framework provides scientific backing and funding language for what Unified Sanctuaries is already designing. The village's energy systems could be explicitly modeled using One Earth's solution pathways, making the project legible to climate finance funders.

### 2. Nature Conservation → Planetary Party + Permatours + Unified Sanctuaries

This is the deepest alignment area. One Earth's conservation framework and the Regenerative Ecosystem share a bioregional worldview.

| One Earth Solution Pathway | Direct Relevance |
|---|---|
| **Protected areas & indigenous tenure** | Kinship Earth's Flow Funding already deploys capital to indigenous-led land stewardship across 12+ bioregions. One Earth's Global Safety Net mapping could directly inform where Flow Funds are prioritized |
| **Ecological corridors & wildlife connectivity** | Planetary Party's bioregional coordination protocol — especially the SENSE and SEE phases — maps ecological relationships across landscapes, which is the same work as identifying corridors |
| **Ecosystem restoration (reforestation, wetlands, mangroves)** | Permatours' 40+ land-based project sites are active restoration work. Food forest installations, permaculture design, and ecological restoration projects are direct implementations |
| **Urban biodiversity** | Permatours' events in the Northeast bioregion include urban and peri-urban sites |
| **Marine & ocean conservation** | Planetary Party is active in coastal/island bioregions (Jamaica, Colombia) where marine solutions are directly relevant |
| **Climate refugia** | Unified Sanctuaries' Southern Vermont site and the Community Land Trust model permanently protect land from speculative development — functionally creating climate refugia |

**Opportunity:** One Earth's **Global Safety Net** mapping tool and the **Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard** (Planetary Party guild) could be powerful complements. The Dashboard could integrate One Earth's spatial data to identify priority conservation areas within each active bioregion.

### 3. Regenerative Agriculture → Permatours + Unified Sanctuaries

This is where the work is most directly overlapping.

| One Earth Solution Pathway | Direct Relevance |
|---|---|
| **Agroforestry & food forests** | Core Permatours activity — 50+ learn-by-doing events, many centered on food forest design and installation |
| **Polyculture & crop diversification** | Unified Sanctuaries' permaculture farm pillar is built on polyculture principles |
| **Soil health & regenerative soil management** | Foundation of permaculture practice across both Permatours and Unified Sanctuaries |
| **Silvopasture & managed grazing** | Relevant to Unified Sanctuaries' land management plan if livestock is integrated |
| **Food waste reduction & bioregional sourcing** | Planetary Party's FLOW phase and bioregional economics reduce food miles and waste by localizing supply chains |
| **Composting & nutrient cycling** | Standard practice at Permatours sites; part of Unified Sanctuaries' closed-loop design |
| **Sustainable textiles / circular fibersheds** | Potential area for Unified Sanctuaries' cooperative economy — hemp and natural fiber production in Vermont |

**Opportunity:** One Earth's regenerative agriculture solutions provide a taxonomy and evidence base for what Permatours and Unified Sanctuaries are doing through practice. Framing the work in One Earth's language makes it legible to agricultural funders, USDA programs, and climate-smart agriculture grants.

## Levers of Change: Where the Ecosystem Already Operates

One Earth identifies seven strategic levers. The Regenerative Ecosystem is already active across all seven:

| One Earth Lever | Ecosystem Initiative | How It Shows Up |
|---|---|---|
| **Philanthro-activism** | **Kinship Earth** | Flow Funding is a direct innovation in philanthro-activism — trust-based, unrestricted, community-directed capital. This is the lever where the ecosystem is most distinctive |
| **Nature/Climate Finance** | **Kinship Earth** | $800K+ raised, $300K+ deployed. The combined $140M capital strategy is a nature/climate finance play at meaningful scale |
| **Policy & Governance** | **Planetary Party** | The Governance Guild and consent-based decision-making protocols are governance innovation. Community Land Trust (Unified Sanctuaries) is a legal/policy mechanism |
| **Science & Technology** | **Planetary Party / Live with Syd** | Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard is a science/technology tool. Live with Syd's privacy-first tech stack (Jitsi, OBS) demonstrates values-aligned technology choices |
| **Legal Empowerment** | **Unified Sanctuaries + Mycelial Law** | Community Land Trust formation, Rights of Nature framing, and partnership with Mycelial Law directly implement legal empowerment |
| **Community Action** | **Permatours** | 50+ events, 40+ sites, 2,000+ subscribers, mutual aid network. This is community action at its most tangible |
| **Education & Culture** | **Live with Syd** | Weekly programming, storytelling, grief transmutation circles, celebration. The CELEBRATE phase of Planetary Party explicitly treats culture as a lever of change |

**Key insight:** One Earth frames these as levers *to be pulled*. The Regenerative Ecosystem has already built **dedicated infrastructure** for each one. This is a strength worth articulating to funders — the ecosystem doesn't just advocate for these levers, it operationalizes them.

## Intersectional Themes: Shared Values

| One Earth Theme | Ecosystem Expression |
|---|---|
| **Gender equity** | Community agreements, consent-based governance, inclusive participation design |
| **Social justice** | Flow Funding to marginalized communities, indigenous land tenure support, anti-extractive economics |
| **Youth leadership** | Permatours' learn-by-doing model, open participation structures |
| **Sustainable livelihoods** | Unified Sanctuaries' cooperative economy, Sol Token system, regenerative tokenomics |
| **Public health** | Healing arts center, bathhouse, grief transmutation circles, herbal education |
| **Water stewardship** | Bioregional organizing by watershed (not political boundary) — water is implicit in the bioregional frame |
| **Biological diversity** | Permaculture practice, food forests, ecological restoration, Rights of Nature framing |

## Strategic Opportunities

### 1. Shared Language for Funders
One Earth's framework is peer-reviewed, widely cited, and recognized by major climate funders. Framing the ecosystem's work using One Earth's solution pathway taxonomy makes it immediately legible to:
- Climate philanthropy (ClimateWorks, Bloomberg, Packard)
- Government programs (USDA climate-smart, DOE community energy)
- Impact investors seeking measurable environmental outcomes

### 2. Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard + Global Safety Net
One Earth's **Global Safety Net** identifies priority areas for conservation. The Planetary Party's **Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard** guild could integrate this data, creating a tool that overlays One Earth's science with community-generated knowledge from the SENSE and SEE phases. This would be a genuine contribution to the field — bridging top-down spatial science with bottom-up bioregional intelligence.

### 3. One Earth Navigator as a Model
One Earth's **Navigator** tool for bioregional exploration could inspire the Dashboard's design. Their approach to organizing data by bioregion (rather than nation-state) mirrors the Planetary Party's philosophy exactly.

### 4. Solutions Hub Listings
One Earth's **Solutions Hub** connects solutions to real-world projects. Each of the ecosystem's initiatives could be submitted as case studies:
- **Kinship Earth** → Philanthro-activism / Nature Finance solution
- **Planetary Party** → Community Action / Governance solution
- **Permatours** → Regenerative Agriculture / Ecosystem Restoration solution
- **Unified Sanctuaries** → Integrated multi-pillar solution (a village-scale demonstration of all three pillars)

### 5. Climate Finance Tracker
One Earth tracks billions in climate funding flows. This data could directly inform Kinship Earth's fundraising strategy and help identify which funders are active in the specific solution pathways the ecosystem addresses.

### 6. Research Collaboration
One Earth has published 45+ peer-reviewed reports. Their energy transition models and conservation mapping could provide the scientific grounding for Unified Sanctuaries' open-source blueprint — moving it from vision document to evidence-backed replicable model.

## Summary

The One Earth solutions framework and Sydney's Regenerative Ecosystem are working the same problem from complementary angles:

- **One Earth** provides the **science, taxonomy, and global mapping** — the what and where of planetary solutions
- **The Regenerative Ecosystem** provides the **social infrastructure, capital mechanisms, and place-based practice** — the how and with whom

One Earth asks: *What solutions does the planet need?*
The Regenerative Ecosystem asks: *How do communities organize to implement them?*

The frameworks are not redundant — they are complementary. One Earth's 75+ solution pathways are the **menu**. The Planetary Party Protocol, Flow Funding, Permatours' hands-on practice, and Unified Sanctuaries' demonstration site are **ways communities can order from that menu** on their own terms.

Adopting One Earth's language and mapping the ecosystem's work to their framework would strengthen fundraising, attract new partners, and position the ecosystem within a globally recognized scientific context — without compromising its values of decentralization, community sovereignty, and trust-based relationships.
