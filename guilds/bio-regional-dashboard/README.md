# Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard Guild

> *Sense-making, mapping, data collection, and impact visibility*

---

## Purpose

The Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard Guild creates the sense-making infrastructure that helps communities and bioregions **see themselves** -- revealing patterns, tracking impact, and making regenerative work visible across the Planetary Party ecosystem.

## What We Build

The dashboard serves as:
- **A mapping tool** -- visualizing relationships, resources, and regenerative projects within bioregions
- **A sense-making platform** -- revealing patterns and connections that aren't obvious in isolation
- **An impact tracker** -- measuring outcomes across ecological, social, and economic dimensions
- **A coordination layer** -- helping different initiatives find synergy and avoid duplication
- **A storytelling canvas** -- making the invisible work of regeneration tangible and shareable

## Core Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Bioregional Mapping** | Documenting places, people, projects, and resources |
| **Data Collection** | Gathering qualitative and quantitative impact data |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Revealing emergent connections and opportunities |
| **Impact Visibility** | Making regenerative outcomes measurable and communicable |
| **Network Intelligence** | Understanding how the ecosystem functions as a whole |

## Why It Matters

Without good sense-making infrastructure:
- Communities can't see their own progress
- Funders can't understand what's working
- Coordination happens through relationships alone (doesn't scale)
- Impact remains invisible or anecdotal
- Learning doesn't transfer between bioregions

The dashboard makes **collective intelligence** operational -- so wisdom generated in one place can inform and accelerate work elsewhere.

## Current Status

**Status:** Needs to be built
**Priority:** High -- essential infrastructure for ecosystem coordination
**Stage:** Design and planning phase

## Technical Approach

The dashboard will need to:
- Be accessible and intuitive for non-technical users
- Work in low-connectivity environments (many bioregions have limited internet)
- Respect data sovereignty (communities control their own data)
- Support multiple languages and cultural contexts
- Enable both local and global views of the network

## Connection Points

- **Planetary Party Protocol** -- supports all five phases (SENSE, SEE, FLOW, CELEBRATE, REGENERATE)
- **Flow Funds** -- provides data for resource allocation and impact tracking
- **Tech Guild** -- partners on implementation and tooling
- **Storytelling Guild** -- transforms data into compelling narratives
- **All other Guilds** -- provides visibility and coordination support

## How to Contribute

This guild is in formation. If you're interested in:
- Participatory mapping and bioregional intelligence
- Dashboard design and data visualization
- Regenerative economics and impact measurement
- Community-owned data infrastructure
- Systems thinking and pattern recognition

...we'd love to connect.
