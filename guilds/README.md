# Guilds

> *Pathways into the Planetary Party Ecosystem*

---

## Overview

Guilds are **living pathways** for different people and organizations to co-create within the Planetary Party ecosystem. They serve as functional participation structures that anyone can join and contribute through -- enabling coordination without centralization.

Each Guild focuses on a specific domain of regenerative work, while the Guild Ecosystem Weaving function coordinates synergy across all guilds.

## The Nine Guilds

| Guild | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Living Systems & Solutions** | Land, food, water, energy, ecological restoration |
| **Capacity Building** | Training, healing, leadership development |
| **Regenerative Capital Flows** | Flow Funds, investment, multi-capital design |
| **Governance** | Participatory systems, collective decision-making, legal scaffolding |
| **Events** | Gatherings, festivals, cultural activations |
| **Storytelling** | Media, myth, narrative infrastructure |
| **Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard** | Sense-making, mapping, data collection, impact visibility |
| **Tech** | Regenerative tooling and interoperability support |
| **Ecosystem Weaving** | Cross-guild synergy and coordination |

## How Guilds Work

- **Open participation** -- anyone aligned with the values can contribute
- **Domain-specific focus** -- each guild has clear scope and expertise
- **Cross-pollination** -- guilds collaborate and share learning
- **Bioregionally grounded** -- work happens in specific places while knowledge scales globally
- **Protocol-aligned** -- guilds support the five-phase Planetary Party Protocol (SENSE, SEE, FLOW, CELEBRATE, REGENERATE)

## Guild Development
