## What You're Stepping Into

The Planetary Party is not an organization you join. It is a living ecosystem you participate in.

It emerged from a simple observation: an extraordinary field of regenerative builders, bioregional organizers, governance innovators, cultural workers, and funders exists worldwide -- largely uncoordinated, under-resourced, and operating in silos. What is missing is not vision or will, but **coordination infrastructure**.

The Planetary Party provides that infrastructure. It operates as three integrated layers:

| Layer | What It Means |
|-------|--------------|
| **A Meme** | An open-source cultural invitation for communities to organize regenerative celebrations anywhere on Earth |
| **A Living System** | A federated network of bioregional nodes, organizations, technologies, tools, frameworks, practitioners, guilds, and Flow Funds |
| **A Cultural Technology** | The Planetary Party Protocol -- a five-phase process guiding communities through sensing, mapping, resourcing, celebrating, and regenerating |

The Planetary Party is a **coordination layer, not an ownership layer**. It is designed so many groups can participate, adapt, and benefit without centralized control. Think of it as the interstitial tissue between aligned movements -- the connective layer that helps what already exists become visible, resourced, and coordinated.

**Anyone can host or participate in a Planetary Party. This is open-source at the level of culture and community.**

---

## Our Mission

To provide the coordination infrastructure that allows regenerative builders, bioregional organizers, funders, governance innovators, and cultural workers to align, resource one another, and scale their work -- without centralization or loss of local sovereignty.

## Our Vision

A world where communities move through cycles of sensing, seeing, flowing resources, celebrating, and regenerating -- producing lasting "positive-trace" infrastructure (gardens, governance models, water systems, strengthened relationships) with each cycle. A whole-system catalyst for building a world that works for all.

---

## Theory of Change

We are facing converging crises -- a legitimacy crisis in institutions, a meaning crisis in culture, a trust crisis in financial systems, a coherence crisis in governance, a relational crisis in communities, and a worldview crisis as fragmentation gives way to interdependence.

The old models -- top-down, extractive, siloed -- cannot address what is emerging. But a different field is already taking shape. Across bioregions worldwide, people are arriving at similar conclusions independently: that regeneration is possible, that coordination must happen at the scale of living systems (watersheds, forests, food systems), and that celebration, culture, and care are not luxuries but essential infrastructure.

**Our theory of change is simple:**

1. **The solutions are already distributed across the collective.** The builders, healers, organizers, technologists, storytellers, and funders already exist. They are already working.

2. **What they lack is coordination, visibility, and resources.** Without a shared layer, efforts remain siloed, duplicated, and under-resourced.

3. **The Planetary Party Protocol provides that shared layer** -- a repeatable, bioregionally-rooted process that helps communities sense their needs, map their assets, flow resources to where they matter, celebrate together (building trust and momentum), and regenerate (learning and deepening with each cycle).

4. **Each cycle produces lasting positive-trace infrastructure** -- not just events, but gardens, governance models, water systems, community resilience, and strengthened relationships.

5. **As bioregions activate and learn from each other, a global coordination web emerges** -- not through centralization, but through federated sovereignty: autonomous bioregions supported by a shared network.

> *"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."* -- Buckminster Fuller

## Core Values

These values are not aspirational slogans. They are design constraints that shape how the ecosystem operates.

**Bioregional Rootedness** -- Change is rooted in specific places: watersheds, cultural landscapes, living ecologies. We organize by bioregion (natural ecosystems and shared culture), not by political or economic borders.

**Rights of Nature** -- Ecological integrity and future generations are prioritized. The land, water, and living systems are not resources to extract from but relationships to steward.

**Federated Sovereignty** -- Autonomous bioregions are supported by a global network, not controlled by it. Each community and bioregion maintains its own decision-making authority.

**Distributed Intelligence** -- Knowledge, wisdom, and decision-making are shared across bioregions without hierarchy. No single actor can see the whole picture alone -- collective intelligence makes the whole visible.

**Celebration as Catalyst** -- Joy, art, ritual, and ceremony are transformation technologies, not afterthoughts. Gatherings build trust, strengthen relationships, and turn insight into momentum.

**Positive-Trace Infrastructure** -- Every gathering, every cycle, every activation leaves lasting regenerative outcomes. We don't just convene -- we build.

---

## Guiding Principles

These principles guide how we work together and how the ecosystem functions:

- **Non-extractive by design.** No one profits from the system itself. The protocol rewards contribution, not speculation.
- **Participation equals influence.** Governance power flows to those who show up, not those who accumulate.
- **Trust-based and relational.** Membership through relationship, conflict through repair, accountability through care.
- **The role is not the soul.** Roles rotate. Titles don't define people. Service defines membership.
- **Repair over punishment.** Conflict resolution is relational first. Removal is a last resort with a pathway to return.
- **Distributed, not decentralized for its own sake.** Power is spread across circles, roles, and communities -- with clear stewardship, not absence of leadership.
- **Room for emergence.** The ecosystem is designed so that communities, organizations, and initiatives beyond any single person's orbit are essential. We are participants in a wider movement, not the whole of it.

## The Planetary Party Protocol

The Protocol is the beating heart of the ecosystem -- a five-phase living spiral that communities move through cyclically. Each turn of the spiral deepens capacity and produces lasting infrastructure.

```
        SENSE
          |
          v
         SEE
          |
          v
        FLOW
          |
          v
      CELEBRATE
          |
          v
      REGENERATE
          |
          +---> (back to SENSE -- a living spiral)
```

### 1. SENSE -- Observe & Listen to Place

*Entering into relationship.*

Circles, assemblies, rituals, and gatherings create space for deep listening -- to land, people, histories, and futures. Communities attune to what is alive, what is needed, and what is asking for care, before moving into action.

### 2. SEE -- Mapping & Meaning-Making Together

*Making the whole visible.*

Stories, culture, ecological knowledge, and shared data come together through dialogue and collective intelligence. Communities make meaning together, revealing patterns, leverage points, and possibilities that no single actor can see alone.

### 3. FLOW -- Moving Resources Like Water

*From insight to action.*

Resources move toward what communities have named as most vital. Local Flow Funds and multi-capital mechanisms support initiatives through trust, relationship, and stewardship -- practicing real governance through choice, accountability, and feedback.

### 4. CELEBRATE -- Convergence & Activation

*Where culture becomes coordination.*

Festivals, ceremonies, and civic gatherings bring people together to activate projects, seed funding, and commit to shared action. These are "positive-trace" festivals -- like transformational festivals, but instead of burning things down, Planetary Parties build lasting regenerative infrastructure and create environments for civic assembly, participatory grantmaking, and showcasing of solutions. Everyone is invited to bring and share their unique gifts.

### 5. REGENERATE -- Learning as a Living Spiral

*Integration and renewal.*

Communities track impact, harvest lessons, and reinvest what's learned into the next cycle. What works is strengthened, what doesn't is adapted, and capacity deepens over time.

## Bioregional Activations & Gatherings

The Protocol is not theoretical. It is being practiced across multiple bioregions right now:

| Bioregion | Status | What's Happening |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Colombia** | Active since Q1 2024 | Bioregioning across Aguaclara, Sinu, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Bogota, and Cali -- forest/watershed restoration, regenerative governance |
| **Jamaica** | Active since Aug 2025 | Partnership with Rastafari Indigenous Village (Montego Bay) on post-hurricane recovery and Indigenous-led stewardship |
| **Mexico** | Active since Oct 2025 | Relationship-building in Cloud Forest bioregion (Veracruz) and Mexico City |
| **Guatemala** | Active since Nov 2025 | The PPP moved from framework to practice through Indigenous-led listening circles and community action around Lake Atitlan |
| **NE Turtle Island** | Active since April 2021 | Bioregional regeneration, food and housing sovereignty, network weaving; bioregional activation series launching soon |

Each bioregion is autonomous. The Planetary Party does not tell bioregions what to do -- it provides a shared rhythm and coordination infrastructure that communities adapt to their own context, culture, and needs.

### Peak Festival Moments

Planetary Parties are designed as magnetic gathering spaces -- places to connect, activate, celebrate, and leave a positive trace. These festivals are also designed to attract wealth holders who witness the impact of their resources live, in real time. Transparent, visual results fueled by the support of financial patrons -- solving the often-cited concerns about lack of transparency in charitable giving.

Each gathering serves the real needs of the host bioregion, and learnings are shared across the network -- weaving together a bioregional learning network that grows stronger with every activation.

## The Guilds: Pathways for Participation

Guilds are living pathways for different people and organizations to co-create within the ecosystem. They are **not departments** -- they are open participation structures that anyone can join and contribute through.

| Guild | Focus | Who It's For |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Living Systems & Solutions** | Land, food, water, energy, ecological restoration | Permaculturists, farmers, land stewards, ecologists |
| **Capacity Building** | Training, healing, leadership development | Educators, healers, facilitators, mentors |
| **Regenerative Capital Flows** | Flow Funds, investment, multi-capital design | Funders, financial innovators, economists, DAO builders |
| **Governance** | Participatory systems, collective decision-making, legal scaffolding | Systems thinkers, lawyers, governance designers |
| **Events** | Gatherings, festivals, cultural activations | Producers, organizers, festival builders |
| **Storytelling** | Media, myth, narrative infrastructure | Filmmakers, writers, journalists, media makers |
| **Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard** | Sense-making, mapping, data collection, impact visibility | Data scientists, cartographers, researchers |
| **Tech** | Regenerative tooling and interoperability support | Developers, engineers, platform builders |
| **Ecosystem Weaving** | Cross-guild synergy and coordination | Connectors, weavers, systems facilitators |

### How guilds work:

- **Open participation** -- anyone aligned with the values can contribute
- **Domain-specific focus** -- each guild has clear scope and expertise
- **Cross-pollination** -- guilds collaborate and share learning across domains
- **Bioregionally grounded** -- work happens in specific places while knowledge scales globally
- **Protocol-aligned** -- guilds support the five-phase Protocol (Sense, See, Flow, Celebrate, Regenerate)

### You don't have to join a guild to participate.

Guilds are one pathway in. If structured participation isn't your thing, you are welcome to simply offer your gifts -- your technology, tools, frameworks, knowledge, creativity, or other contributions -- to the ecosystem in whatever way feels authentic. The ecosystem is designed to receive many kinds of contribution.

## A Trusted Network: Sharing Your Gifts Safely

One of the most important things to understand about the Planetary Party is that it functions as a **trusted network**.

We recognize that many of you carry significant intellectual property -- technologies, tools, frameworks, methodologies, research, creative works, and other innovations. You may have been burned before by spaces that extracted your ideas without credit, reciprocity, or care. This ecosystem is designed differently.

**What you can expect:**

- **Your IP is yours.** Sharing a tool, framework, or technology with the ecosystem does not mean giving it away. You decide how your contributions are used, credited, and shared.
- **Reciprocity is a core value.** The ecosystem operates on mutual aid and reciprocity, not extraction. When you contribute, the network contributes back -- through connections, resources, amplification, and collaboration.
- **Consent before everything.** Nothing is recorded, shared, or redistributed without explicit permission. This applies to ideas shared in sessions, frameworks presented to guilds, and tools offered to bioregional activations.
- **Community agreements protect the space.** Our 10 core community agreements (below) create a container where honest sharing is possible because trust is actively maintained.
- **Credit and attribution matter.** When your work, frameworks, or ideas inform the ecosystem's direction, that lineage is honored and made visible.

The Planetary Party is an interstitial layer between aligned movements -- not a platform that absorbs your work into its own brand. Your participation strengthens the whole while your contributions remain your own.

---

## Community Agreements

These agreements create the container of trust that makes everything else possible. By participating, you agree to uphold them:

1. **Come with presence and intention.** Arrive grounded, curious, and willing to listen as much as you speak.
2. **Honor confidentiality.** What's shared in the space stays in the space unless explicit permission is given.
3. **Speak from lived experience.** Use "I" statements. Avoid speaking on behalf of entire groups or communities.
4. **No harassment, hate, or harmful speech.** Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or dehumanizing language will not be tolerated.
5. **Respect the container.** Wait to be invited to speak. Use raise-hand or chat features when available.
6. **Consent before recording or sharing.** Do not record, screenshot, or redistribute content without explicit permission.
7. **Honor time and space.** Keep contributions concise and relevant so others can be heard.
8. **Stay curious, not combative.** We welcome diverse perspectives, offered with care and humility.
9. **Support collective coherence.** If something feels off, name it respectfully or reach out to a moderator.
10. **Right to removal.** Moderators may mute, remove, or ban participants who violate these agreements.

**Conflict resolution is relational first.** If something comes up, you can message a moderator privately. Serious issues may result in pausing or redirection. Follow-up dialogue and repair are always offered.

## The Wider Ecosystem

The Planetary Party does not exist in isolation. It is one part of a wider constellation of interconnected initiatives, each capable of operating independently while thriving together:

| Initiative | What It Does | Scale |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Planetary Party** | Coordination protocol -- how we coordinate without centralizing | Global |
| **Kinship Earth** | Flow Funding -- how money moves differently (trust-based, unrestricted grants to grassroots leaders) | Global |
| **Permatours** | Permaculture action & mutual aid network -- how people learn and build together | NE Bioregion |
| **Unified Sanctuaries** | Land-based regenerative village -- what this looks like when rooted in land | Local (Vermont) |
| **Live with Syd** | Advocacy & community platform -- how we build community and tell the story | Global |

Together, these address the full spectrum of what regenerative transformation requires: **coordination**, **capital**, **capacity**, **place**, and **voice**.

### Kinship Earth & Flow Funding

Kinship Earth serves as the financial backbone of the ecosystem. Its Flow Funding model moves unrestricted resources directly to trusted grassroots leaders and bioregional organizers -- no grant applications, minimal reporting, grounded in trust. Kinship Earth has deployed $370,000+ to 23 Flow Funders across 12+ bioregions globally. The PPP operationalizes Kinship Earth's flow funding methodology at global scale, helping bioregions develop their own Flow Funds.

---

## Governance: How Decisions Get Made

The Planetary Party uses a governance structure that mirrors its values -- distributed, consent-based, and rooted in living systems:

- **Core Fractal** -- A small coordinating body (currently Syd Harvey Griffith, Josie Watson, Juan Carlos Kaiten) that holds coherence without centralizing control
- **Earth Council** -- Indigenous wisdom keepers providing seasonal guidance
- **Guild-Based Participation** -- Distributed decision-making through nine open guilds
- **Federated Sovereignty** -- Autonomous bioregions supported by a global network, not controlled by it
- **Consent-Based Process** -- Decisions rooted in deep listening, collective mapping, and relational accountability

As the ecosystem matures, governance will continue to evolve through community proposals, seasonal iteration, and emergent design. You are invited to participate in shaping it.

## How to Step In

There is no single "right way" to enter the Planetary Party. Here are pathways based on where you are:

| If you want to... | You can... |
|-------------------|-----------|
| **Explore** | Attend a Live with Syd session (Wednesdays are Planetary Party-focused), join a Discord server, or reach out to a steward |
| **Contribute your gifts** | Offer your technology, tools, frameworks, creative work, or expertise to a guild or bioregional activation |
| **Join a guild** | Express interest in any of the nine guilds and begin contributing in your domain |
| **Activate your bioregion** | Host a Planetary Party in your bioregion using the shared Protocol and documentation |
| **Plug into an existing activation** | Join an activation already underway in Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico, Guatemala, or NE Turtle Island |
| **Support with resources** | Donate through Kinship Earth to support coordination infrastructure and bioregional Flow Funds |
| **Partner** | Bring your organization into the ecosystem as a collaborator |

### The participation pathway:

```
DISCOVER --> REGISTER --> LISTEN --> CONTRIBUTE --> DEEPEN --> LEAD
   (social media,     (screening)    (attend       (share when    (guild        (facilitate,
    events, word                      sessions,     invited,       membership,    present,
    of mouth)                         chat)         offer gifts)   stewardship)   co-create)
```

This is fluid, not hierarchical. Move at whatever pace feels right. Some people stay at the listening level for months before contributing. Others dive into guild work immediately. Both are welcome.

## A Final Word

The Planetary Party is not asking you to abandon what you're already building. It is offering a coordination layer that makes your work more visible, more resourced, and more connected to a global web of aligned efforts.

You are not joining an organization. You are stepping into a living pattern -- one that many people across the world are already embodying. A pattern that says: we can heal the world through collective creation, we can regenerate through celebration, and we can build coherence through trust and shared intention.

The solutions are already distributed across the collective. Our work is to convene, weave, and steward.

Welcome to the party.
