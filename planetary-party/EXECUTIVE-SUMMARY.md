# The Planetary Party: Executive Summary

**A Bioregional Coordination Ecosystem Aligning Collective Intelligence, Regenerative Enterprise, and Values-Anchored Stewardship Capital**

*Prepared: February 2026*

## The Opportunity

We are witnessing converging crises -- a legitimacy crisis in institutions, a meaning crisis in culture, a trust crisis in financial systems, a coherence crisis in governance, a relational crisis in communities, and a worldview crisis as fragmentation gives way to interdependence. At the same time, an extraordinary field of regenerative builders, bioregional organizers, governance innovators, and cultural workers is emerging worldwide -- largely uncoordinated, under-resourced, and operating in silos.

The Planetary Party exists to connect what is already emerging.

---

## What It Is

**The Planetary Party** is both a cultural meme and a lived movement of regenerative celebration already happening around the world. **The Planetary Party Protocol** is the practical coordination layer that helps these efforts align, resource one another, and scale -- without centralization.

It operates as three integrated layers:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **A Meme** | An open-source cultural invitation for communities to organize regenerative celebrations anywhere on Earth |
| **A Living System** | A federated network of bioregional nodes, Flow Funds, nine functional Guilds, intelligence dashboards, and embassies |
| **A Cultural Technology** | A five-phase Protocol guiding communities through sensing, mapping, resourcing, celebrating, and regenerating |

The Planetary Party is a coordination layer, not an ownership layer -- designed so many groups can participate, adapt, and benefit without centralized control.

---

## The Five-Phase Protocol

The Protocol follows a living spiral rhythm that communities move through cyclically:

| Phase | Name | What Happens |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **SENSE** | Deep listening to place, people, histories, and futures through circles, assemblies, and ritual |
| 2 | **SEE** | Collective mapping and meaning-making -- revealing patterns, leverage points, and possibilities through shared intelligence |
| 3 | **FLOW** | Resources move toward what communities have named as vital, through trust-based Flow Funds and multi-capital mechanisms |
| 4 | **CELEBRATE** | Festivals, ceremonies, and civic gatherings activate projects, seed funding, and build relational momentum |
| 5 | **REGENERATE** | Communities track impact, harvest lessons, and reinvest learning into the next cycle -- deepening capacity over time |

Each cycle produces lasting "positive-trace" infrastructure: gardens, governance models, strengthened relationships, water systems, and ongoing community capacity for collective action.

---

## Guild Ecosystem

Nine functional Guilds serve as living pathways for co-creation across the ecosystem:

| Guild | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Living Systems & Solutions** | Land, food, water, energy, ecological restoration |
| **Capacity Building** | Training, healing, leadership development |
| **Regenerative Capital Flows** | Flow Funds, investment, multi-capital design |
| **Governance** | Participatory systems, collective decision-making, legal scaffolding |
| **Events** | Gatherings, festivals, cultural activations |
| **Storytelling** | Media, myth, narrative infrastructure |
| **Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard** | Sense-making, mapping, data collection, impact visibility |
| **Tech** | Regenerative tooling and interoperability support |
| **Ecosystem Weaving** | Cross-guild synergy and coordination |

Guilds are not departments -- they are open participation structures that anyone can join and contribute through.

---

## Core Values

- **Bioregional Rootedness** -- Change rooted in specific places: watersheds, cultural landscapes, living ecologies
- **Rights of Nature** -- Prioritizing ecological integrity and future generations
- **Federated Sovereignty** -- Autonomous bioregions supported by a global network
- **Distributed Intelligence** -- Knowledge-sharing across bioregions without centralized control
- **Celebration as Catalyst** -- Joy, art, and ritual as transformation technologies
- **Positive-Trace Infrastructure** -- Every gathering leaves lasting regenerative outcomes

---

## Traction: Active Bioregional Engagements

The Protocol is already active across multiple bioregions, with Kinship Earth serving as the primary philanthropic backbone for Bioregional Flow Funding:

| Bioregion | Status | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Colombia** | Active since Q1 2024 | Bioregioning across Aguaclara, Sinu, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Bogota, Cali -- forest and watershed restoration, regenerative governance. Flow Funds preparing for Q1 2026. |
| **Jamaica** | Active since Aug 2025 | Partnership with Rastafari Indigenous Village (Montego Bay) on post-hurricane recovery and Indigenous-led stewardship |
| **Mexico** | Active since Oct 2025 | Relationship-building across regenerative communities in the Cloud Forest bioregion (Veracruz) and Mexico City |
| **Guatemala** | Active since Nov 2025 | PPP moved from framework to practice through Indigenous-led listening circles and community action |
| **Northeast Turtle Island / U.S.** | Launching Q1 2026 | Bioregional activation and learning series -- mapping, collaboration, disaster preparedness, and Flow Funding readiness |

---

## Wider Ecosystem Context

The Planetary Party sits within a constellation of four interconnected initiatives at different scales, all stewarded by Syd Harvey Griffith. These are participants in a wider movement, not a closed loop:

| Initiative | Role | Scale | Status |
|------------|------|-------|--------|
| **Planetary Party** | Cultural & Coordination Protocol | Global | Active -- Planning & Activation |
| **Kinship Earth** | Flow Funding & Regenerative Capital (501c3) | Global | Active nonprofit |
| **Permatours** | Permaculture Action & Mutual Aid Network | Northeast Bioregion | Active (50+ events, 40+ projects since 2021) |
| **Unified Sanctuaries** | Land-Based Regenerative Village | Local (Southern Vermont) | Pre-acquisition / Planning |

**Critical design principle:** These four are not a closed system where everything feeds everything else. Each maintains its own integrity, communities, and ethical boundaries -- especially around funding. The Planetary Party is a scaffold that many groups beyond this constellation can plug into.

## Project Plan

### Phase 1: Build the Coordination Layer
Fund core coordination, storytelling, and governance infrastructure to establish a coherent backbone for the Protocol.

### Phase 2: Assemble the Ecosystem
Onboard collaborators, partners, and guild members. Launch cross-domain Guilds (Storytelling, Tech, Finance, Governance, Land, Culture).

### Phase 3: Activate Bioregionally
Connect projects, capital, and capacity through shared rhythms. Pilot Planetary Party activations. Support bioregional hosts in adapting the Protocol locally.

### Phase 4: Enable Distributed Adoption
Support other regions in hosting Planetary Parties independently using shared documentation, tooling, and learnings.

### Phase 5: Maintain Coherence Without Control
Hold alignment through shared values, community agreements, and relational accountability -- without centralization or hierarchy.

## Why Now

> *"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."* -- Buckminster Fuller

The regenerative movement is no longer nascent -- it is a field phenomenon. Builders, organizers, funders, and cultural workers across every continent are arriving at the same conclusions independently. What is missing is not vision or will, but coordination infrastructure.

The Planetary Party is not an escape from reality or a utopian fantasy. It is a grounded, joyful, relational, and coordinated way of building something better -- together. A whole-system catalyst for imagineering a world that works for all.

The field is ready. The party has already begun.
