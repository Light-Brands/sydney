**Date:** February 17, 2026
**Participants:** Syd Harvey, Juan Carlos Kaiten
**Context:** One-on-one alignment check-in ahead of Wednesday team meeting

## Key Takeaways

### Alignment & Trust
- Both feel strongly aligned and trust each other. The challenge is not trust between individuals but rather **operational alignment** -- making sure shared agreements are visible and enacted in day-to-day work.
- Jenny's framing was helpful: the issue isn't trust in each other, it's trust in the *process* and readiness.

### Stage of the Project
- The team has crossed the threshold from startup ambiguity into a phase that demands **action and consolidation**.
- The theory of exchange, governance, and onboarding frameworks are "not perfect but good enough to go."
- Both agree: **don't overcomplicate things to move forward**. The team is still small enough to be agile without deep formal training processes.

### Capacity & Pace
- JC has been heavily focused on relational and network-weaving work (hosting visitors in Tepoztlan, nurturing partnerships with Theramonia / Frequency Network / potential funders). This has limited his bandwidth for operational tasks.
- Syd wants to **start implementing and learn by doing** -- the team will evolve faster once in motion.
- JC agrees and does not want to be a brake on momentum. He can live with imperfections (e.g., website copy) and catch up iteratively.
- Broader team capacity is limited because nobody is resourced full-time yet. No hard feelings -- everyone is doing their best.

### Onboarding Layers (Three-Layer Model)
1. **Core Team** -- Nadim, Sherry, and existing stewards. Organized by areas of development (not yet full "guilds").
2. **Guild Members** -- Pivot Earth, Zachary, Marlow, and others onboarded into guilds with defined social functions. This becomes the second ask for funding.
3. **Community Level** -- Melina (Colombia), Gabby (Veracruz), etc. A different organizational architecture for on-the-ground bioregional engagement.

### Governance Philosophy
- Governance is a **process rooted in principles**, not strict policies. It is ever-evolving.
- Syd and JC are aligned on using flexible, principle-based language rather than rigid rules.
- JC should be involved in anything created for the public or funders to infuse the right language and framing.

## Agreements

1. **Move into action now.** Start implementing existing frameworks (onboarding, governance, roles) rather than waiting for perfection.
2. **Sherry's onboarding.** JC will take responsibility for properly onboarding Sherry on mission, vision, and existing agreements so the group doesn't slow down waiting for her availability.
3. **Constant check-ins over gatekeeping.** Move freely and faster, but maintain regular check-ins to stay aligned and course-correct.
4. **Wednesday meeting purpose.** JC will facilitate the Wednesday team meeting to:
   - Embody and enact the agreements already documented
   - Define 3-month objectives and who owns what
   - Clarify the purpose and agenda structure for each recurring meeting
   - Introduce a lightweight project management approach (visual Gantt-style tracking)
5. **Meeting structure reform.** Establish clear, purposeful agendas for each meeting type:
   - Short tactical check-ins (~20 min on Mondays): "Are you clear on your tasks? What do you need?"
   - Longer strategic sessions: review direction, messaging, and priorities
6. **Financial ask before JC's funder dinner.** Prepare an itemized budget / ask before JC's dinner (Wednesday or Thursday) with a potential funder who is considering redirecting capital toward Planetary Party.
7. **Async work is essential.** Do meaningful work outside of meetings and update each other asynchronously so live meetings focus on what can only be done together.
8. **Syd going live.** JC supports Syd going public about the Planetary Party -- sharing on streams, inviting team members and partners to speak, and framing the NE bioregional activation series as part of the Planetary Party.
9. **Condense AI-generated documents.** When using AI to draft materials, keep outputs concise and reviewable. Long documents slow down alignment. (Directed mainly at Josie and Jenny, not Syd.)
