# The Planetary Party Protocol
## Incoming Partner Packet

---

*Welcome to the ecosystem. This packet is your orientation to who we are, what we're building, how we work together, and what it means to be part of this trusted global network in service of life.*

---

## 1. What Is the Planetary Party?

The Planetary Party is a trusted global network in service of life, regeneration, bioregions, and the planet. We exist as the **interstitial layer between aligned movements** -- connecting regenerative builders, bioregional organizers, governance innovators, funders, cultural workers, and communities worldwide who are arriving at similar conclusions independently but working in silos.

We are not an organization, a brand, or an ideology. We are:

**A Meme** -- An open-source cultural invitation for communities to organize regenerative celebrations anywhere on Earth.

**A Living System** -- A federated network of organizations, technologies, tools, frameworks, bioregional land-based nodes, guilds, and practitioners serving life and the regenerative movement.

**A Cultural Technology** -- The Planetary Party Protocol (PPP) -- a five-phase rhythm guiding communities through sensing, mapping, resourcing, celebrating, and regenerating.

The Planetary Party is a **coordination layer, not an ownership layer**. It is designed so that many groups -- including yours -- can participate, adapt, and benefit without centralized control. Each partner maintains its own integrity, communities, and ethical boundaries. The PPP is a scaffold that many groups can plug into.

## 2. Our Theory of Change

### The Problem

We are witnessing converging crises:

- **A legitimacy crisis** in institutions
- **A meaning crisis** in culture
- **A trust crisis** in financial systems
- **A coherence crisis** in governance
- **A relational crisis** in communities
- **A worldview crisis** as fragmentation gives way to interdependence

An extraordinary field of regenerative builders is emerging worldwide. What is missing is not vision or will -- it is **coordination infrastructure**. Thousands of aligned projects, communities, and movements are doing vital work in isolation, duplicating efforts, competing for the same resources, and unable to see or support one another.

### The Solution

The Planetary Party provides the coordination infrastructure that allows regenerative builders to **align, resource one another, and scale their work** -- without centralization or loss of local sovereignty.

We orient toward what we call the **Third Attractor** -- not collapse on one hand, and not centralized extractive control on the other, but a living direction of travel that cultivates the capacities required to steward powerful tools, technologies, and resources with care, accountability, and integrity.

### How Change Happens

Change happens through a **living spiral**: communities sense what is alive and needed, map their collective intelligence, move resources toward what matters, celebrate and build momentum together, then harvest lessons and deepen capacity for the next cycle. Each turn of the spiral produces lasting **positive-trace infrastructure** -- gardens, governance models, water systems, strengthened relationships, and ongoing community capacity.

This is not top-down change. It is emergent, place-based, and relational -- rooted in the intelligence of bioregions and the gifts of the people who inhabit them.

---

## 3. Mission, Vision & Values

**Mission:** To provide the coordination infrastructure that allows regenerative builders, bioregional organizers, funders, governance innovators, and cultural workers to align, resource one another, and scale their work -- without centralization or loss of local sovereignty.

**Vision:** A world where communities move through cycles of sensing, seeing, flowing resources, celebrating, and regenerating -- producing lasting positive-trace infrastructure with each cycle. A whole-system catalyst for building a world that works for all.

### Core Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Bioregional Rootedness** | Change rooted in specific places: watersheds, cultural landscapes, living ecologies |
| **Rights of Nature** | Prioritizing ecological integrity and future generations |
| **Federated Sovereignty** | Autonomous bioregions supported by a global network, not controlled by it |
| **Distributed Intelligence** | Knowledge-sharing across bioregions without hierarchy |
| **Celebration as Catalyst** | Joy, art, and ritual as transformation technologies, not afterthoughts |
| **Positive-Trace Infrastructure** | Every gathering leaves lasting regenerative outcomes |

### Guiding Principles

- **Protocol, not platform** -- We are a coordination layer that many groups can plug into without centralized ownership.
- **Consent-based process** -- Decisions are rooted in deep listening, collective mapping, and relational accountability.
- **Open-source culture** -- Anyone can host a Planetary Party. The meme is free. The Protocol is shared.
- **Sovereignty preserved** -- Partners maintain their own identity, mission, governance, and communities. This is a network, not an acquisition.
- **Emergence over engineering** -- We create conditions for regenerative systems to take shape through relationship, practice, and shared learning -- not top-down design.

---

## 4. The Five-Phase Protocol

The PPP follows a living spiral rhythm. Communities move through these phases cyclically, with each cycle deepening capacity and producing lasting infrastructure.

### Phase 1: SENSE -- Observe & Listen to Place
*Entering into relationship*

Circles, assemblies, rituals, and gatherings create space for deep listening -- to land, people, histories, and futures. Communities attune to what is alive, what is needed, and what is asking for care, before moving into action.

### Phase 2: SEE -- Mapping & Meaning-Making Together
*Making the whole visible*

Stories, culture, ecological knowledge, and shared data come together through dialogue and collective intelligence. Communities reveal patterns, leverage points, and possibilities that no single actor can see alone.

### Phase 3: FLOW -- Moving Resources Like Water
*From insight to action*

Resources move toward what communities have named as most vital. Local Flow Funds and multi-capital mechanisms support initiatives through trust, relationship, and stewardship -- practicing real governance through choice, accountability, and feedback.

### Phase 4: CELEBRATE -- Convergence & Activation
*Where culture becomes coordination*

Festivals, ceremonies, and civic gatherings bring people together to activate projects, seed funding, and commit to shared action. Celebration becomes a coordination technology -- building trust, strengthening relationships, and turning insight into momentum.

### Phase 5: REGENERATE -- Learning as a Living Spiral
*Integration and renewal*

Communities track impact, harvest lessons, and reinvest what's learned into the next cycle. What works is strengthened, what doesn't is adapted, and capacity deepens over time.

```
  SENSE --> SEE --> FLOW --> CELEBRATE --> REGENERATE
    ^                                         |
    +-------- (next cycle deepens) -----------+
```

## 5. Bioregional Activations & Peak Festival Moments

The PPP is not theoretical. It is being practiced across bioregions right now.

### Community Engagement Process

Each bioregion follows the five-phase Protocol adapted to local context. Engagement begins with **listening** -- entering into relationship with the people, land, and existing efforts in a place. From there, communities map what exists, identify needs, mobilize resources through Flow Funds, celebrate through gatherings, and harvest learnings to carry forward.

### Active Bioregions

| Bioregion | Status | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Colombia** | Active since Q1 2024 | Bioregioning across Aguaclara, Sinu, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Bogota, Cali -- forest/watershed restoration, regenerative governance |
| **Jamaica** | Active since Aug 2025 | Partnership with Rastafari Indigenous Village (Montego Bay) on post-hurricane recovery and Indigenous-led stewardship |
| **Mexico** | Active since Oct 2025 | Relationship-building in Cloud Forest bioregion (Veracruz) and Mexico City |
| **Guatemala** | Active since Nov 2025 | Indigenous-led listening circles and community action around Lake Atitlan |
| **NE Turtle Island** | Active since April 2021 | Bioregional regeneration, food and housing sovereignty, network weaving; bioregional activation series launching soon |

### Peak Festival Moments

Planetary Parties serve as **magnetic convergence points** -- gatherings designed to connect, activate, celebrate, and leave a positive trace. In the spirit of transformational festivals, but instead of burning down beautiful art, Planetary Parties build lasting regenerative infrastructure. They create environments for civic assembly, participatory grantmaking, and showcasing solutions to the crises we face locally and globally.

These gatherings are designed to:

- Activate projects and seed funding in real time
- Attract aligned resource holders who witness impact live
- Serve the real needs of host bioregions
- Generate learnings shared across the global network
- Participate in the gift economy -- everyone brings and shares their unique gifts

---

## 6. The Guild Ecosystem

Guilds are open participation structures -- living pathways for different people and organizations to co-create within the ecosystem. They are not departments or committees. They are domains of practice that anyone aligned with the values can contribute through.

| Guild | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Living Systems & Solutions** | Land, food, water, energy, ecological restoration |
| **Capacity Building** | Training, healing, leadership development |
| **Regenerative Capital Flows** | Flow Funds, investment, multi-capital design |
| **Governance** | Participatory systems, collective decision-making, legal scaffolding |
| **Events** | Gatherings, festivals, cultural activations |
| **Storytelling** | Media, myth, narrative infrastructure |
| **Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard** | Sense-making, mapping, data collection, impact visibility |
| **Tech** | Regenerative tooling and interoperability support |
| **Ecosystem Weaving** | Cross-guild synergy and coordination |

### Participation Is Voluntary

Guild participation is an invitation, not a requirement. As a partner, you are welcome to:

- **Join one or more Guilds** that align with your skills, interests, and mission
- **Contribute across Guilds** on specific projects or initiatives
- **Simply offer your gifts** -- your tools, frameworks, technologies, IP, methodologies, or other contributions -- without joining any Guild formally

There is no single way to participate. The ecosystem is designed to meet you where you are and honor what you bring.

## 7. What It Means to Be a Partner

### You Are Joining a Trusted Network

The Planetary Party ecosystem is built on trust, relationship, and shared values. Being a partner means you are part of a curated, values-aligned global network of organizations and individuals working in service of life and regeneration. This is not an open marketplace -- it is a **trusted web of relationships** where integrity, care, and mutual accountability are foundational.

### Your Sovereignty Is Preserved

Joining the PPP ecosystem does not mean merging with, being acquired by, or subordinating your mission to anyone else's. You retain full ownership of your organization, your intellectual property, your communities, and your decision-making. The PPP is a scaffold you plug into -- a coordination layer that amplifies your work through connection, not one that absorbs it.

### What Partners Bring

Partners contribute in many ways:

- **Tools & Technologies** -- Software, platforms, hardware, or digital infrastructure
- **Frameworks & Methodologies** -- Governance models, assessment tools, facilitation processes, curricula
- **Intellectual Property** -- Research, content, designs, protocols, or other knowledge assets
- **Networks & Relationships** -- Connections to communities, funders, institutions, or movements
- **On-the-Ground Capacity** -- Ability to activate, organize, or implement in specific bioregions
- **Capital & Resources** -- Financial support, in-kind contributions, or resource mobilization
- **Cultural & Creative Gifts** -- Art, music, storytelling, ceremony, healing practices

### What Partners Receive

- **Visibility & Amplification** -- Your work is seen, celebrated, and connected to a global audience of aligned practitioners
- **Cross-Pollination** -- Access to tools, frameworks, and knowledge from across the ecosystem that can strengthen your own work
- **Collaboration Opportunities** -- Connections to aligned partners for joint projects, co-funding, and shared learning
- **Bioregional Deployment Pathways** -- Opportunities to deploy your offerings in active bioregional activations worldwide
- **Community & Belonging** -- Participation in a global network of people and organizations who share your values and are doing this work together
- **Flow Fund Access** -- Potential pathways to resources through Bioregional Flow Funding as it scales

---

## 8. Sharing Your Gifts Safely: Trust, IP & Integrity

We recognize that partners often bring sensitive intellectual property -- proprietary tools, unpublished frameworks, original methodologies, creative works, and other assets developed through significant investment of time, resources, and care. **We take this seriously.**

### Our Commitments to You

- **Your IP remains yours.** Sharing tools, frameworks, or knowledge within the ecosystem does not transfer ownership. You decide the terms of use, licensing, and distribution.
- **Consent-based sharing.** Nothing you share will be redistributed, repurposed, or attributed without your explicit consent.
- **Attribution and credit.** When your contributions are referenced, used, or built upon, you will be credited clearly and appropriately.
- **Boundary respect.** If you share something in confidence, in a working session, or in draft form, it stays in that context unless you say otherwise.
- **No extraction.** The PPP is designed as a coordination layer, not an extraction layer. We are not here to aggregate your IP into a centralized product. We are here to help your gifts reach the places and people who need them -- on your terms.

### How This Works in Practice

- Partners define their own sharing terms when contributing tools, content, or frameworks
- Guild collaborations operate under shared agreements about co-created work
- Sensitive materials shared in working groups or calls are treated as confidential by default
- Partners can participate at whatever level of openness they are comfortable with -- from fully open-source contributions to tightly scoped, permission-based sharing

If you have specific concerns about IP protection, licensing, or confidentiality, raise them with the coordination team. We will work with you to find arrangements that honor your boundaries and serve the ecosystem.

## 9. Vouch for Aligned Partners

This ecosystem grows through **trust-based invitation**. If you know organizations, communities, or individuals whose work is aligned with the values and mission of the Planetary Party, we invite you to vouch for them.

### How Vouching Works

- **Identify aligned partners** -- people or organizations doing regenerative, bioregional, or life-serving work that would benefit from and contribute to this network
- **Make an introduction** -- connect them to the coordination team or invite them to an ecosystem call
- **Share this packet** -- give them this document so they can understand what the PPP is and what partnership means
- **Vouch with integrity** -- a vouch is a relational act. It says: "I know this person or organization, I trust their work and values, and I believe they would be a good fit for this ecosystem."

We are not trying to grow for the sake of growth. We are cultivating a **network of trust** -- and your relational knowledge is one of the most valuable assets in building that.

---

## 10. Governance & How We Organize

### Structure

The PPP operates through a federated, consent-based governance model:

- **Core Fractal** -- A coordinating body (Syd Harvey Griffith, Josie Watson, Juan Carlos Kaiten) that holds the backbone infrastructure and facilitates coherence
- **Earth Council** -- Indigenous wisdom keepers providing seasonal guidance and grounding the work in deep-time knowledge
- **Nine Open Guilds** -- Distributed participation and domain-specific decision-making
- **Bioregional Nodes** -- Autonomous regions with federated sovereignty, supported by but not controlled by the global network

### Decisions Are Made Through

- Deep listening and collective sensing
- Consent-based processes (not majority rule)
- Relational accountability
- Transparency and shared documentation

### Fiscal & Legal Structure

- **Fiscal Sponsor:** Kinship Earth (501c3 nonprofit)
- **Design Principle:** The PPP is a coordination protocol, not a standalone legal entity. It is a scaffold that many groups plug into.
- Formal partnerships are supported through MOUs and clear accountability structures as needed.

## 12. Getting Started: Your First Steps

### Immediate

1. **Read this packet.** You're doing that now.
2. **Reflect on your gifts.** What do you bring? Tools, frameworks, networks, capital, creative capacity, on-the-ground presence? There is no wrong answer.
3. **Identify your entry points.** Are there Guilds that align with your work? Bioregions where you're already active? Partners you'd like to connect with?

### Within Your First Month

4. **Join an ecosystem call.** Regular open calls are held for partners to connect, share updates, and coordinate. The coordination team will connect you.
5. **Share what you'd like to offer.** Let us know what gifts, tools, or capacities you want to make available to the ecosystem -- and on what terms.
6. **Vouch for others.** If you know aligned partners who should be part of this network, introduce them.

### Ongoing

7. **Participate at your own pace.** There is no minimum commitment. Show up as you're called to. Contribute when it's alive for you. The ecosystem is designed to honor different rhythms and capacities.
8. **Stay in relationship.** This network runs on trust and relational accountability. Stay connected, communicate openly, and ask for what you need.

---

## A Final Word

The Planetary Party is not trying to replace what you're already doing. It is trying to **connect** what you're already doing to a larger field of aligned action -- so that the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.

We are building the coordination infrastructure for a regenerative world. Not through centralized control, but through shared rhythms, trusted relationships, open participation, and the radical act of celebrating together while building something that lasts.

You are here because someone in this network trusts your work and believes your gifts belong in this ecosystem. We are glad you're here.

Welcome to the Planetary Party.
