# **Planetary Party Protocol**

## **Internal Funding & Priority Summary**

(9–12 Month Execution Window)

## **1\. Purpose of This Document**

The intention of this document is to align the core team on:

* What we are prioritizing right now

* How much funding is needed and why

* What is donor-funded vs investable

* What must happen before what

* How we speak about this consistently

It is an internal coordination document so we move with clarity and coherence.

---

## **2\. Core Strategy** 

Our strategy follows a clear sequence:

1. Stabilize the system through governance

2. Assemble and onboard the ecosystem

3. Evolve the model through bioregional pilots

Some work happens simultaneously.

This sequencing:

* Reduces execution risk

* Prevents burnout

* Makes capital use legible and responsible

* Allows both donors and investors to engage appropriately

## **4\. What Is Investable vs Donor-Funded**

### **Donor-Funded (Commons & Care)**

Donor capital supports:

* Governance & administration

* Legal & fiscal containers

* Coordination & communications

* Flow Funds

* Community engagement & assemblies

* Storytelling & learning

Why: These functions hold trust, equity, and long-term impact.

---

### **Investable (Durable Infrastructure)**

Investor capital may support:

* Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard

* Learning infrastructure & certification pathways

* Toolkits, playbooks, and service platforms

* Interoperable tech systems

Why: These assets create long-term utility and potential returns.

Investment  within the Planetary Party Protocol is always governed by the commons.

Capital is deployed into activities that generate revenue and surplus, and returns are tied to those cash flows \- not to ownership or control.

Investment does not confer equity, voting rights, or decision-making power. Governance remains with the people and communities directly involved in and impacted by the work.

All investment opportunities are structured through Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) that sit within a commons-aligned trust framework, ensuring that capital serves the long-term health of the ecosystem rather than extracting value from it.

The commons aligned trust framework refers to a legal and governance container where assets, IP, land, revenue rights, or operating vehicles are:

* Held in trust for a shared purpose (the commons)  
* Governed by clear stewardship obligations, not private ownership  
* Protected from capture, sale, or control by capital  
* Oriented toward long-term regenerative benefit, not short-term extraction

The trust exists to protect the mission, the community, and the ecosystem \- not to maximize private gain.
