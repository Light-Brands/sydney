# Planetary Party

> *A Bioregional Coordination Ecosystem -- Global*

**Website:** [planetaryparty.com](https://www.planetaryparty.com/)
**Entity:** Cultural coordination protocol (fiscal sponsorship through Kinship Earth)
**Scale:** Global
**Status:** Active -- planning and activation across 5+ bioregions

---

## Overview

The Planetary Party is both a cultural meme -- an open-source invitation for communities to organize regenerative celebrations anywhere on Earth -- and the **Planetary Party Protocol (PPP)**, a practical coordination layer that helps regenerative efforts align, resource one another, and scale without centralization.

It operates as three integrated layers:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **A Meme** | An open-source cultural invitation for regenerative celebration anywhere on Earth |
| **A Living System** | A federated network of bioregional nodes, Flow Funds, nine functional Guilds, and embassies |
| **A Cultural Technology** | A five-phase Protocol guiding communities through sensing, mapping, resourcing, celebrating, and regenerating |

The Planetary Party is a **coordination layer, not an ownership layer** -- designed so many groups can participate, adapt, and benefit without centralized control.

## The Five-Phase Protocol

| Phase | Name | What Happens |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **SENSE** | Deep listening to place, people, histories, and futures through circles, assemblies, and ritual |
| 2 | **SEE** | Collective mapping and meaning-making -- revealing patterns, leverage points, and possibilities |
| 3 | **FLOW** | Resources move toward what communities have named as vital, through trust-based Flow Funds |
| 4 | **CELEBRATE** | Festivals, ceremonies, and civic gatherings activate projects, seed funding, and build momentum |
| 5 | **REGENERATE** | Communities track impact, harvest lessons, and reinvest learning into the next cycle |

Each cycle produces lasting "positive-trace" infrastructure: gardens, governance models, water systems, and ongoing community capacity.

## Nine Functional Guilds

| Guild | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Living Systems & Solutions | Land, food, water, energy, ecological restoration |
| Capacity Building | Training, healing, leadership development |
| Regenerative Capital Flows | Flow Funds, investment, multi-capital design |
| Governance | Participatory systems, collective decision-making, legal scaffolding |
| Events | Gatherings, festivals, cultural activations |
| Storytelling | Media, myth, narrative infrastructure |
| Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard | Sense-making, mapping, data collection, impact visibility |
| Tech | Regenerative tooling and interoperability support |
| Ecosystem Weaving | Cross-guild synergy and coordination |

## Active Bioregional Deployments

| Bioregion | Status | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Colombia** | Active since Q1 2024 | Forest/watershed restoration, regenerative governance across 5 regions |
| **Jamaica** | Active since Aug 2025 | Post-hurricane recovery, Indigenous-led stewardship with Rastafari Indigenous Village |
| **Mexico** | Active since Oct 2025 | Cloud Forest bioregion (Veracruz) and Mexico City |
| **Guatemala** | Active since Nov 2025 | Indigenous-led listening circles around Lake Atitlan |
| **NE Turtle Island** | Launching Q1 2026 | Bioregional activation series -- mapping, collaboration, Flow Funding readiness |

## What Makes It Unique

- **Protocol, not platform** -- a coordination layer that many groups can plug into
- **Celebration as catalyst** -- joy, art, and ritual as transformation technologies
- **Positive-trace infrastructure** -- every gathering leaves lasting regenerative outcomes
- **Federated sovereignty** -- autonomous bioregions supported by a global network
- **Built-in media production** -- every event documented for storytelling and distribution
- **Nine open Guilds** -- participation structures anyone can join and contribute through

## Core Values

- Bioregional Rootedness -- change rooted in specific places
- Rights of Nature -- prioritizing ecological integrity and future generations
- Federated Sovereignty -- autonomous bioregions, not centralized control
- Distributed Intelligence -- knowledge-sharing without hierarchy
- Celebration as Catalyst -- joy and ritual as transformation technologies
