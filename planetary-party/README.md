# Planetary Party

> *Cultural & Coordination Protocol -- Global*

Planetary Party is a cultural and coordination protocol designed to serve **many ecosystems**, not just Syd's own projects. It produces festivals, gatherings, and community events that build the relational fabric connecting people to regenerative living, to each other, and to the land. It is inherently global -- a scaffold that many groups can plug into, a coordination layer rather than an ownership layer.

## What It Is

A community engagement and event production platform focused on:

- **Regenerative festivals** (e.g., Leave a Positive Trace)
- **Cultural gatherings** -- singing circles, theater, immersive arts, concerts
- **Educational events** -- governance workshops, permaculture education, community-building courses
- **Cross-ecosystem gatherings** -- events that bring together many different networks, organizations, and communities, including but not limited to Syd's other initiatives

Planetary Party is not just a party. It's a connective ritual space designed to support emergence beyond any single person's immediate orbit.

## Role in the Wider Movement

- Provides **gathering infrastructure** that many ecosystems and communities can use -- not just Syd's projects
- Generates **visibility and storytelling** content that can support diverse fundraising efforts
- Creates spaces where **many networks intersect** -- including but not limited to Permatours, Kinship Earth, and Unified Sanctuaries
- Creates **donor touchpoints** that convert attendees into supporters of regenerative work broadly
- Produces **media and IP** (footage, performances, recordings) that become ongoing revenue streams

## What Makes It Unique

- Events are designed as **entry points** into a regenerative lifestyle, not one-off entertainment
- A **coordination layer, not an ownership layer** -- designed so many groups can participate and benefit
- Built-in **media production** captures every event for storytelling, documentary content, and online distribution
- Programming blends **celebration with education** -- every gathering teaches something
- Rooted in **consent culture, inclusion, and ecological ethics**

## Scoping Questions to Resolve

### Identity & Positioning

### Events & Programming

### Operations & Structure

- [ ] Budget framework for a first event?

### Revenue Model

### Digital Presence
- [ ] Website scope -- standalone site, or a section within a broader ecosystem presence?
- [ ] Social media strategy and channels
- [ ] Email list and community building pre-launch

## Initial Planning Steps

1. **Define the brand** -- name confirmation, tagline, visual identity direction, audience
2. **Map the event calendar** -- what events, when, where, at what scale
3. **Clarify the entity structure** -- how Planetary Party legally relates to the other three projects
4. **Scope the first event** -- format, budget, venue, team, timeline
5. **Build the storytelling engine** -- how every event generates content that feeds the ecosystem

## Key People

- **Syd Harvey Griffith** -- Lead designer and driving force behind Planetary Party. Syd conceived this as the convergence point for all her worlds -- where regenerative finance meets festival culture, where grassroots organizing becomes immersive experience, and where community engagement catalyzes systemic transformation. A movement builder who has supported 40+ land-based projects and pioneered trust-based flow funding, Syd brings an unmatched ability to turn a gathering into a launchpad for real change. She doesn't just throw events -- she engineers entry points into a regenerative future.
- **Eslerh** -- Film production, multimedia, ritual theater
- **Michael (Fuego)** -- Festival production, financial operations

## Connection Points

- **<-> Unified Sanctuaries**: Could host gatherings at the site when it exists; US is one venue among many, not the primary beneficiary
- **<-> Permatours**: Network gatherings and practitioner involvement at events
- **<-> Kinship Earth**: Storytelling content supports broader fundraising; relationship is collaborative, not financially circular
- **<-> Other orgs & communities**: PP is designed as a scaffold that many groups can plug into -- supporting emergence beyond Syd's immediate orbit
