# Planetary Party

> *A Bioregional Coordination Ecosystem -- Global*

**Purpose:** The Planetary Party exists to provide the coordination infrastructure -- through celebration, shared protocol, and federated bioregional networks -- that enables regenerative builders, organizers, funders, and cultural workers worldwide to align, resource one another, and produce lasting positive-trace infrastructure without centralization or loss of local sovereignty.

**Website:** [planetaryparty.com](https://www.planetaryparty.com/)
**Entity:** Cultural coordination protocol (fiscal sponsorship through Kinship Earth)
**Scale:** Global
**Status:** Active -- planning and activation across 5+ bioregions

## Overview

The Planetary Party is both a cultural meme -- an open-source invitation for communities to organize regenerative celebrations anywhere on Earth -- and the **Planetary Party Protocol (PPP)**, a practical coordination layer that helps regenerative efforts align, resource one another, and scale without centralization.

It operates as three integrated layers:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **A Meme** | An open-source cultural invitation for regenerative celebration anywhere on Earth |
| **A Living System** | A federated network of organizations, technologies, tools, frameworks, bioregional land-based nodes / community centers, guilds serving bioregions, and practitioners serving life and the regenerative movement |
| **A Cultural Technology** | A protocol guiding bioregional communities through sensing, mapping, resourcing, celebrating, and regenerating |

The Planetary Party is a **coordination layer, not an ownership layer** -- designed so many groups can participate, adapt, and benefit without centralized control.

## The Five-Phase Protocol

| Phase | Name | What Happens |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **SENSE** | Deep listening to place, people, histories, and futures through circles, assemblies, and ritual |
| 2 | **SEE** | Collective mapping and meaning-making -- revealing patterns, leverage points, and possibilities |
| 3 | **FLOW** | Resources move toward what communities have named as vital, through trust-based Flow Funds |
| 4 | **CELEBRATE** | Festivals, ceremonies, and civic gatherings activate projects, seed funding, and build momentum |
| 5 | **REGENERATE** | Communities track impact, harvest lessons, and reinvest learning into the next cycle |

Each cycle produces lasting "positive-trace" infrastructure: gardens, governance models, water systems, and ongoing community capacity.

## Nine Functional Guilds (To Start)

| Guild | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Living Systems & Solutions | Land, food, water, energy, ecological restoration |
| Capacity Building | Training, healing, leadership development |
| Regenerative Capital Flows | Flow Funds, investment, multi-capital design |
| Governance | Participatory systems, collective decision-making, legal scaffolding |
| Events | Gatherings, festivals, cultural activations |
| Storytelling | Media, myth, narrative infrastructure |
| Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard | Sense-making, mapping, data collection, impact visibility |
| Tech | Regenerative tooling and interoperability support |
| Ecosystem Weaving | Cross-guild synergy and coordination |

## Active Bioregional Engagement

| Bioregion | Status | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Colombia** | Active since Q1 2024 | Forest/watershed restoration, regenerative governance across 5 regions |
| **Jamaica** | Active since Aug 2025 | Post-hurricane recovery, Indigenous-led stewardship with Rastafari Indigenous Village |
| **Mexico** | Active since Oct 2025 | Cloud Forest bioregion (Veracruz) and Mexico City |
| **Guatemala** | Active since Nov 2025 | Indigenous-led listening circles around Lake Atitlan |
| **NE Turtle Island** | Active since April 2021 | Bioregional regeneration, food and housing security / sovereignty, and network weaving; bioregional activation series launching soon |

## What Makes It Unique

- **Protocol, not platform** -- a coordination layer that many groups can plug into
- **Celebration as catalyst** -- joy, art, and ritual as transformation technologies
- **Positive-trace infrastructure** -- every gathering leaves lasting regenerative outcomes
- **Federated sovereignty** -- autonomous bioregions supported by a global network
- **Built-in media production** -- every event documented for storytelling and distribution
- **Nine open Guilds** -- participation structures inviting aligned people and groups to join

## Core Values

- Bioregional Rootedness -- change rooted in specific places
- Rights of Nature -- prioritizing ecological integrity and future generations
- Federated Sovereignty -- autonomous bioregions, not centralized control
- Distributed Intelligence -- knowledge-sharing without hierarchy
- Celebration as Catalyst -- joy and ritual as transformation technologies

## Summary

The Planetary Party is a global bioregional coordination ecosystem that operates as a cultural meme, a living system, and a cultural technology. Through its five-phase protocol -- Sense, See, Flow, Celebrate, Regenerate -- it guides communities in building lasting regenerative infrastructure rooted in place. Nine functional guilds provide the participation structures for aligned individuals and organizations to contribute across domains ranging from living systems and governance to storytelling and ecosystem weaving. With active bioregional engagement spanning Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico, Guatemala, and NE Turtle Island, and supported by a growing network of partners and stewards, the Planetary Party serves as a coordination layer -- not an ownership layer -- enabling many groups to participate, adapt, and benefit without centralized control.
