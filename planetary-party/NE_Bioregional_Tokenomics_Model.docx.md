*A co-creation of the regenerative communities of the Northeast — Turtle Island*

# **1\. Executive Summary**

The NE Bioregional Tokenomics Model is a proposed framework for community currency, collective governance, and resource coordination across the wider ecosystem of regenerative communities, mutual aid networks, land projects, and grassroots organizations in the Northeast bioregion of Turtle Island — the name Indigenous peoples use for North America. This bioregion spans the Hudson Valley, Connecticut River Valley, Western Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and surrounding watersheds. These are the ancestral and continuing homelands of the Wabanaki Confederacy, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, and many other Indigenous nations whose traditions of ecological reciprocity, council-based governance, and land stewardship are part of the deep roots this work grows from.

The model currently includes two tokens — **BioUT** (Bioregional Utility Token for exchange and mutual aid) and **BioVT** (Bioregional Voice Token for governance) — with the possibility of additional tokens as the ecosystem evolves. The final names for these tokens will be chosen by the bioregional community itself as part of the co-design process. BioUT and BioVT are working names.

The spirit of this work is co-creation. This is not a system being built for the bioregion — it is a system being built by and with the bioregion. The goal is to weave a shared economic and governance layer that builds cohesion across communities, supports collective decision-making, enables resource and knowledge sharing, facilitates trade and exchange between neighbors, and reduces dependency on imported goods and extractive systems. It is an invitation for the communities of the Northeast to govern their own commons, value each other’s contributions, and grow a bioregional economy rooted in reciprocity rather than extraction.

This project builds on years of on-the-ground work across the bioregion. Networks like Permatours — which was itself kickstarted by a regenerative crypto grant from SEEDS and has direct experience deploying crypto-based rewards to those who contributed to garden installs, infrastructure builds, and mutual aid projects — have already tested community tokenomics in practice. Kinship Earth’s Flow Funding has deployed over $370,000 to grassroots leaders across 12+ bioregions, with the Northeast as a primary hub. The Planetary Party Protocol has piloted bioregional governance experiments starting with the NE Eco-Communities Convergence. The relationships, trust, and infrastructure already exist. This tokenomics model gives them a shared layer for exchange, governance, and coordination.

## **Why Now?**

The Northeast bioregion is home to dozens of interconnected regenerative communities, farms, community centers, and land-based projects that already practice mutual aid, skill-sharing, and collaborative stewardship. What’s missing is a shared economic and governance layer that makes these relationships visible, reciprocal, and scalable — without extractive intermediaries.

The Bioregional Tokenomics Model addresses this by creating a commons economy where contributions are tracked, valued, and exchangeable across communities; where governance power flows to those who show up consistently; where knowledge, skills, and resources circulate locally rather than leaking out to extractive systems; and where the bioregion itself becomes more self-sufficient, interconnected, and resilient.

# **2\. The Token Model**

The NE Bioregional Tokenomics Model currently includes two tokens, designed to be non-extractive, participation-based, regenerative, and distributed. It separates economic activity from governance power so that neither can be used to dominate the other. Additional token types may be introduced by the community as the ecosystem evolves.

## **2A. BioUT — Bioregional Utility Token (Exchange & Mutual Aid)**

**What It Is**

A community currency that measures and rewards real-world contributions across the bioregion. 1 BioUT \= $1 USD equivalent in internal value. Non-liquid — cannot be exchanged for cash.

**How You Earn BioUT**

* Hands-on labor at land projects, builds, permaculture installs, community events

* Teaching, facilitation, mentoring, healing arts offerings

* Cooking, childcare, driving, logistics, cleanup at community events

* Communications, storytelling, media production for ecosystem partners

* Admin, coordination, grant writing, resource stewardship work

* Weaving work: connecting people, matching needs with offers across communities

* Any verified contribution to a participating community or project

**How You Spend BioUT**

* Access workshops, classes, and trainings across any participating community

* Trade for handmade goods, food, art, tools, and services in the Bioregional Marketplace

* Pay for permaculture consulting, natural building expertise, wellness offerings

* Request mutual aid: labor swaps, transport, childcare, project support

* Access shared tools, equipment, and build materials from the commons

* Support partner communities and land projects directly

**Supply & Stability Mechanics**

* Seasonal minting cap: new BioUT minted per season cannot exceed 30% of circulating supply

* Proof of work: peer confirmation \+ QR check-in system, not passive attendance

* Automatic sinks: event fees, advanced trainings, shared tool access, Commons Treasury contributions

* Dormant token redistribution: BioUT unused for 2+ seasons gets 20% contributed to Commons

* Transfer limits to prevent hoarding and whale dynamics

* Seasonal supply audits at Bioregional Assemblies

## **2B. BioVT — Bioregional Voice Token (Governance)**

**What It Is**

A governance token that grants decision-making influence across the bioregional network. Non-transferable, non-economic, and participation-based. BioVT accrues through showing up and contributing, and decays when you step away. This ensures governance reflects current participation, not historical accumulation.

**How You Earn BioVT**

* 5 BioVT per community event attended (as a Member)

* 1 BioVT per 4 verified hours of organizational / coordination work

* Circle Steward stipend: 5–10 BioVT per season

**Governance Mechanics**

* Max holding: 40 BioVT — no governance whales

* Decay: 20% per season, keeping power current not historical

* Use up to 5 BioVT per proposal to signal priority

* Emergency proposals require 5 BioVT from 5 different Members

* Quorum: 20% of Members / 51% majority for standard decisions

* 50% quorum for governance-level changes

**Three Layers of Bioregional Power**

* **Economic Power \= BioUT** (what you contribute and exchange)

* **Governance Power \= BioVT** (your voice in collective decisions)

* **Cultural Power \= Reputation** (trust, relationships, presence)

# **5\. Bioregional Structure**

The tokenomics model uses a circle-based governance structure for multi-community coordination. Each participating community maintains its own internal coordination while plugging into the shared bioregional layer. This structure honors the sovereignty of each community while creating coherent channels for cross-community collaboration, trade, knowledge sharing, and collective decision-making.

## **Circles (Bioregional Scale)**

* **Builders:** Natural building, permaculture, land restoration, skilled trades, and project execution across community sites

* **Weavers:** Cross-community coordination, needs/offers matching, rideshare organizing, relationship building between nodes

* **Storytellers:** Bioregional media, event documentation, newsletters, content creation, partner amplification

* **Resource Stewards:** Grant writing, fundraising, treasury management, BioUT/BioVT oversight, financial transparency

* **Governance / Evolution:** Bioregional covenant stewardship, assembly facilitation, governance tooling, long-term system design

* **Care Stewards:** Conflict resolution, emotional processing, safety protocols, Pathways of Peace training across communities

## **Membership**

Membership in the bioregional tokenomics network follows a trust-based model:

* Attend 3+ cross-community events or contribute verified labor at 3+ participating sites

* Receive 3 vouches from existing Members

* Read and agree to the Bioregional Covenant

* Complete light-touch onboarding (1-click form, join bioregional channels, optional welcome call)

## **Seasonal Assemblies (State of the Bioregion)**

Four times per year, aligned with the ecological rhythms of the bioregion, communities pause to zoom out together:

* BioUT supply audit and velocity check

* Marketplace health review and vendor revalidation

* Culture review and conflict tending

* Circle reports and role rotation

* Bioregional needs assessment

* Proposal batch voting

* Resource flow planning for the upcoming season

# **6\. Participating Networks & Ecosystem Context**

The NE Bioregional Tokenomics Model is designed to serve the existing constellation of regenerative communities, networks, and land projects already active across the Northeast bioregion. The following are examples of networks and ecosystems that could leverage and co-steward the model:

## **Permatours**

A bioregional mutual aid and education network rooted in permaculture, natural building, disaster preparedness, and community-led projects across the Northeast. Permatours was kickstarted by a regenerative crypto grant from SEEDS and has direct experience deploying crypto-based rewards to contributors who supported garden installs, infrastructure builds, and mutual aid work. The network has already developed and tested a robust community tokenomics and governance framework including utility tokens, voice tokens, circle-based roles, quest systems, seasonal assemblies, and a Commons Treasury — providing a proven operational foundation that the bioregional tokenomics model can build on and extend.

## **Kinship Earth Flow Funding**

* Trust-based, unrestricted funding deployed to grassroots leaders and land-based projects

* Funded 12+ bioregions, with the Northeast as a primary hub

* Educating bioregional communities how to set up their own Bioregional Flow Funds 

* Co-creating bioregional activation series (in person and online events) to support bioregion’s with their relationship building and mapping efforts (in preparation for launching Flow Funds as well as other avenues to unlock capital, including developing their own regenerative tokenomics models)

## **Planetary Party Protocol (PPP)**

* A bioregional learning network and governance experiment platform spanning 12+ bioregions globally

* The Northeast was the first PPP pilot location (NE Eco-Communities Convergence)

* PPP guilds (BioIntel, Governance, Capital Flows, Storytelling, Living Solutions, Capacity Building) provide cross-cutting infrastructure for bioregional coordination

* Cross-bioregional interoperability between the NE tokenomics model and other PPP bioregions is a long-term goal

## **Community Centers, Farms, & Land Projects**

* Community centers strengthened through builds, workshops, and mutual aid exchanges

* Farms, food forests, and land stewardship projects across the Hudson Valley, Western MA, Connecticut River Valley, Vermont, and beyond

* Partner organizations working in regenerative agriculture, Indigenous sovereignty, disaster preparedness, and community resilience

* Existing timebanks, barter networks, and informal economies that BioUT could complement or integrate with

# **7\. How to Get Involved**

# **8\. Guiding Principles**

* **Non-extractive by design:** No one profits from the system itself. Tokens reward contribution, not speculation.

* **Participation \= influence:** Governance power flows to those who show up, not those who accumulate.

* **Trust-based and relational:** Membership through vouching, conflict through repair, accountability through care.

* **Seasonal and ecological:** Governance anchored in the ecological rhythms of this bioregion. Assemblies, role rotation, and audits follow the seasons.

* **Sovereignty of each community:** Participating communities maintain their own internal coordination. The tokenomics model is a shared layer, not a governing body.

* **Distributed, not decentralized for its own sake:** Power is spread across circles, roles, and communities — with clear stewardship, not absence of leadership.

* **Regenerative reciprocity:** The Commons Treasury breathes — protecting the community when low, nourishing it when high. Biomimicry, not bureaucracy.

* **The role is not the soul:** Roles rotate. Titles don’t define people. Service defines membership.

* **Repair over punishment:** Conflict resolution is relational first. Offboarding is a last resort with a pathway to return.

* **Rooted in place:** This token belongs to this bioregion — to its watersheds, forests, soils, and the peoples who have stewarded them since time immemorial. We honor the Wabanaki and Haudenosaunee traditions of ecological reciprocity and council-based governance as deep roots this land carries, and we build in relationship with — not in place of — those traditions.

# **9\. Immediate Next Steps**

This is a living document and an invitation. Here’s what’s needed now:

1. **Circulate this document** to bioregional community leaders, land stewards, and aligned organizations for feedback and co-design input.

2. **Convene the first working group call** — bring together token designers, community organizers, and governance thinkers to begin co-designing.

3. **Identify 5–10 pilot communities** willing to test BioUT and BioVT at their next events and projects.

4. **Launch the bioregional needs & offers map** — a living document of what each community can contribute and what they need.

5. **Begin technical platform evaluation** — assess Hypha, custom DAO tooling, and lightweight alternatives for the pilot.

6. **Name the tokens together** — the bioregion decides what to call its own currency and governance voice.

*This is an invitation to weave something together.*

The bioregion is already alive with the relationships, skills, and care this needs.

*The token just makes it visible.*
