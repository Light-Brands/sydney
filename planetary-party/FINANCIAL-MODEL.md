## 1. Capital Architecture Overview

The Planetary Party Protocol (PPP) operates as a **cultural coordination protocol** — not a single enterprise, but a federated infrastructure that channels capital from global sources to bioregional communities through a trust-based, commons-aligned framework.

**Fiscal Sponsors:**
- **Kinship Earth** (501(c)(3) Private Foundation) — Philanthropic capital
- **Na'luea Living Trust** — Impact investment capital

**Relationship:** Board-approved MOUs with compliance mechanisms, fiduciary accountability, and transparent financial reporting.

### How Capital Moves Through the System

```

**Core principle:** Capital enters through a single coordination layer and flows outward in service of global shared infrastructure and local bioregional solutions. Communities — not the PPP — decide how resources are deployed within their bioregions.

---

## 2. Sources of Capital

The PPP is structured to receive multiple classes of capital, each governed by distinct terms and deployed toward appropriate uses.

### 2.1 Philanthropic Capital (Tax-Deductible Donations)

| Source Type | Deployment | Governance |
|---|---|---|
| Individual donors | Community deployment, core operations, governance design | Kinship Earth board oversight |
| Family foundations | Bioregional pilots, capacity building, storytelling | Grant agreements with reporting |
| DAFs / donor-advised funds | Community seed capital, community engagement | Standard DAF compliance |

**Fiscal sponsor traction:** Kinship Earth has raised $800,000+ since Q4 2024 and deployed $370,000+ to 23 community leaders across 12+ bioregions globally.

### 2.2 Impact Investment Capital (Returns-Bearing)

| Vehicle | Asset Class | Returns Structure |
|---|---|---|
| Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) | Tech infrastructure, platforms | Revenue-linked, not equity-based |
| Commons-aligned trust instruments | Dashboard, learning systems | Capped returns; no governance rights |
| Mission-aligned loan structures | Bioregional activation working capital | Low-interest, patient capital |

**Fiscal sponsor:** Na'luea Living Trust manages impact investment capital through commons-aligned structures.

**Critical governance constraint:** Investment capital does NOT confer voting rights, decision-making power, or ownership over community governance. All investment is held within commons-aligned trust frameworks.

### 2.3 Earned Revenue

| Stream | Source | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Event & festival revenue | Ticket sales, vendor fees, sponsorships | Active now; scaling with bioregional activations |
| Media & content licensing | Storytelling Guild productions, Micelio Media | Phase 2+ |
| Platform & service fees | Dashboard access, certification pathways, toolkits | Phase 2+ |
| Community currency transaction fees | BioUT marketplace activity | Phase 3+ |

### 2.4 Government & Institutional Grants

| Source | Alignment | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Federal resilience / disaster preparedness | Bioregional disaster readiness programming | Prospective |
| State / municipal community development | Community deployment in specific jurisdictions | Prospective |
| International development (USAID, GEF, etc.) | Bioregional restoration, Rights of Nature | Prospective |

## 4. Unit Economics: Per-Bioregion Activation

Understanding the cost structure of a single bioregional activation is essential for modeling scale.

### 4.1 Bioregion Activation Cost Stack

| Category | % of Budget | Amount ($250K base) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Community deployment capital | 20% | $50,000 | Unrestricted grants — the highest-leverage dollar |
| Community engagement & assemblies | 20% | $50,000 | The protocol in practice — sensing, seeing, flowing, celebrating |
| Facilitation & logistics | 16% | $40,000 | Experienced practitioners, travel, venue, accessibility |
| Storytelling & documentation | 14% | $35,000 | Impact capture, narrative infrastructure, case studies |
| Local partner onboarding | 12% | $30,000 | Relationship building, readiness assessment |
| Local enterprise & capacity development | 10% | $25,000 | Community enterprise support, economic development |
| Learning synthesis | 8% | $20,000 | Feedback loops into global ecosystem |

### 4.2 Bioregion Scaling Economics

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Activation cost per bioregion | $250,000 | $200,000 | $160,000 |
| Cost reduction driver | — | Reusable toolkits, trained facilitators | Local revenue, community self-funding |
| Community deployment capital per bioregion | $50,000 | $75,000 | $125,000 |
| Expected local earned revenue | $0 | $25,000–50,000 | $75,000–150,000 |
| Ongoing annual sustaining cost | — | $120,000 | $80,000 |

**Key insight:** Activation costs decrease as the toolkit matures and local capacity grows. By Year 3, bioregions generate meaningful earned revenue through events, marketplace activity, and community enterprise — reducing dependency on external capital.

### 5.2 PPP Revenue Offsets (Earned + Recurring vs. Operations)

| Year | Event Revenue | Platform Fees | Media Licensing | Community Currency Fees | Total Earned | Net Operations Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2026** | $50,000 | — | $10,000 | — | $60,000 | $810,000 |

| **ECOSYSTEM TOTAL** | **$6.2M** | **$17.5M** | **$31M** | **$62M** | **$105M** |

---

## 6. Investable vs. Donor-Funded Allocation

Maintaining a clear distinction between what can receive impact investment and what must remain donor-funded is critical for mission alignment and legal compliance.

### 6.1 Donor-Funded (Non-Investable)

These activities are core public goods and community services that cannot generate financial returns and must remain free from investor influence.

| Category | Annual Cost (at scale) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Governance & decision-making architecture | $40,000 | Commons governance cannot be owned |
| Legal & fiscal containers | $60,000 | Structural integrity, not revenue-generating |
| Core coordination & administration | $70,000 | Operational backbone |
| Community engagement, assemblies & care | $100,000 per bioregion | Relational work, not transactional |
| Storytelling, documentation & learning | $55,000 per bioregion | Public knowledge goods |

### 6.2 Investable (Can Generate Returns)

These are infrastructure assets that produce revenue through usage, licensing, or fees — and can accept patient, commons-aligned capital.

| Asset | Investment Required | Revenue Mechanism | Projected Annual Revenue (Year 3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard | $30,000 (design) → $150,000 (build) | Platform access fees, data services | $100,000–$200,000 |
| Learning platforms & certification | $35,000 (design) → $200,000 (build) | Course fees, certification revenue | $150,000–$300,000 |
| Toolkits, playbooks & service bundles | $15,000 (design) → $50,000 (production) | Licensing, consulting, training | $50,000–$100,000 |
| Community currency platforms | $100,000 (design + beta) | Transaction fees (1–3%) | $50,000–$200,000 |
| Media & content licensing | $50,000 (production) | Licensing, syndication, distribution | $80,000–$250,000 |
| **TOTAL INVESTABLE** | **$230,000–$550,000** | | **$430,000–$1,050,000** |

---

## 7. Ecosystem Revenue Model & Path to Sustainability

| Event & festival revenue | $350,000–$600,000 |
| Platform & certification fees | $100,000–$300,000 |
| Media licensing | $80,000–$150,000 |
| Community currency fees | $40,000–$100,000 |
| **Total** | **$1,270,000–$2,550,000** |

**Long-Term (2030+): Earned Revenue Majority**

| Stream | Projected Annual Revenue |
|---|---|
| Event revenue (global federation of festivals) | $900,000–$1,500,000 |
| Platform, certification & toolkit licensing | $350,000–$700,000 |
| Media & content licensing | $250,000–$400,000 |
| Community currency transaction fees | $200,000–$500,000 |
| Continued philanthropy | $500,000–$1,000,000 |
| Government & institutional grants | $200,000–$500,000 |
| **Total** | **$2,400,000–$4,600,000** |

### 7.2 Path to Operational Sustainability

| Year | Total Revenue | Total Operating Cost | Surplus / (Gap) | Philanthropic Dependency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026 | $510,000 | $870,000 | ($360,000) | 88% |
| 2027 | $850,000 | $1,600,000 | ($750,000) | 73% |
| 2028 | $1,700,000 | $2,200,000 | ($500,000) | 55% |
| 2029 | $2,800,000 | $2,800,000 | Break-even | 36% |
| 2030 | $3,800,000 | $3,100,000 | $700,000 | 26% |

**The PPP reaches operational break-even by 2029** as earned revenue from platforms, events, and licensing matures. Community deployment capital continues to be funded through philanthropic and impact capital channels — which is by design, not a sign of dependency.

## 9. Investment Governance & Returns Structure

### 9.1 Principles

1. **No extraction.** Returns are tied to revenue generation, never to ownership, equity, or community assets.
2. **No governance capture.** Investment does not confer voting rights, board seats, or decision-making power over communities.
3. **Commons protection.** All investment is held within commons-aligned trust frameworks that prioritize mission permanence.
4. **Transparency.** Quarterly financial reporting, annual impact reporting, and open-book accounting.

## 11. Risk Factors & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fundraising shortfall** — Insufficient capital to complete Phase 1–3 | Medium | High | Phased deployment model allows partial execution at lower range of budget estimates; each phase has a minimum viable scope |
| **Bioregional activation delays** — Community readiness varies | Medium | Medium | Protocol designed for adaptive timing; sensing phase surfaces readiness before capital is deployed |
| **Key-person dependency** — Small core team | Medium | High | Governance design (Phase 1) distributes authority; guild structure builds distributed leadership |
| **Technology build risk** — Dashboard or platform underperforms | Low | Medium | Aggregation-first strategy reduces build risk; partnering with existing tools before building new ones |
| **Mission drift under investment pressure** — Investor expectations misalign with commons values | Low | High | SPV structure with capped returns and no governance rights; commons-aligned trust wrapper is legally binding |
| **Regulatory / fiscal sponsor risk** — IRS or compliance issues | Low | High | Phase 1 invests $50K–$60K in legal and fiscal architecture specifically to mitigate this; dual fiscal sponsor structure provides resilience |
| **Community currency volatility** — Token economics destabilize | Low | Medium | Non-liquid design (1 BioUT = $1, non-cashable); seasonal minting caps; dormant token redistribution |
| **Replication quality** — Scaling too fast degrades community outcomes | Medium | Medium | Toolkit and learning infrastructure (Phase 2) ensures quality; each bioregion activates through full protocol cycle |
