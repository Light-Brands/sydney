## Agreements

Arrive grounded, curious, and willing to listen as much as you speak.

### 2. Honor Confidentiality
What's shared in the space stays in the space unless explicit permission is given.

### 3. Speak from Lived Experience
Use "I" statements. Avoid speaking on behalf of entire groups or communities.

### 4. No Harassment, Hate, or Harmful Speech
Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or dehumanizing language will not be tolerated.

### 5. Respect the Container
Wait to be invited to speak. Use the raise-hand or chat feature when available.

### 6. Consent Before Recording or Sharing
Do not record, screenshot, or redistribute content without explicit permission.

### 7. Honor Time & Space
Keep contributions concise and relevant so others can be heard.

### 8. Stay Curious, Not Combative
We welcome diverse perspectives, offered with care and humility.

### 9. Support Collective Coherence
If something feels off, name it respectfully or reach out to a moderator.

### 10. Right to Removal
Moderators may mute, remove, or ban participants who violate these agreements.
