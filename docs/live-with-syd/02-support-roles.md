## Types of Support Needed

To do this well, support is needed to help set up and steward the tech, operations, community, and content side of this ecosystem. Specifically: designing and running a clean, ethical, low-stress tech and operations stack — from registration and anti-spam gates, to live room moderation, to publishing replays and nurturing community across Discord, socials, and email.

The goal is privacy-respecting, consent-based, and scalable. Some of this is a one-time setup lift; some is ongoing support.

## Roles

### Tech & Systems Support
Design and/or maintain the live session infrastructure (registration forms, automations, live rooms, Notion hub, recordings). Mostly remote, with optional in-person support if local and excited to help set up the physical hosting space.

### Live Session & Community Support
Moderators and community stewards who help protect the container during sessions, manage participation flow, and support healthy Discord spaces. Fully remote — values-aligned facilitation matters as much as technical skill.

### Content & Publishing Support
Help turning live sessions into replays, clips, newsletters, and other shareable resources so the work has a longer tail and reaches beyond who's live.

### Guest / Speaker Coordination & Program Curation
Support holding relationships with guest contributors, reviewing session proposals, and helping the overall arc of the offerings feel coherent rather than scattered.

### Heart-Sharing Facilitation
Trauma-informed facilitators for the non-recorded circles, held with care and clear boundaries.

### Admin & Ops Support
Help coordinating roles, timelines, budgets, and payments so Syd isn't holding everything alone.

> Some people may want to take on one focused role; others might naturally blend a few (for example, moderator + community manager, or tech + automation).

## How to Express Interest

Anyone interested is invited to share:

1. What role(s) they'd be excited to support
2. How much time/energy they realistically have
3. What funding they'd need to do the work well (project-based, hourly, or monthly)

Or, if not available — recommend someone who could help.
