## Evaluated Platforms

| Platform | Plan / Tier | Approx. Cost | Capacity | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Livestorm** | Pro | ~€99-€110/month | Up to 500 attendees | GDPR-compliant webinar platform. Plan scales with active contacts (up to 1,000+). Best balance of webinar features. |
| **Univid** | Growth | ~€99/month | ~100 live participants | Webinar-focused; GDPR compliant, but standard plan limits to ~100 participants; custom tier likely needed for 150+. |
| **alfaview** | Business 500 | ~€7.63/month | ~500 participants | GDPR-hosted in EU, includes video/audio up to ~200 on video, others as viewers; strong for meetings/events. |
| **Pexip** | Connect Essentials | ~US$39-$20+/month per room | Scales with configuration | Enterprise solution with variable pricing — quote required for full event/webinar use; starting room prices low but full event webinar costs custom. |
| **Jitsi** (Self-Hosted) | Open-Source Self-Host | $0 software + hosting | Scales with server | Free software; you pay only server/infra costs (e.g., ~$5-$80+/mo for VPS). Moderation features are more basic; streaming/recording require extra setup. |
