## A. Opening Script (2-3 minutes)

> "Welcome everyone. I'm so glad you're here.
>
> This is an intentional space for shared learning, reflection, and co-creation.
>
> Before we begin, a few quick notes:
>
> - Everyone is muted on entry to protect the container
> - You're welcome to keep your camera on or off
> - If you'd like to speak, please raise your hand or share in the chat
> - We'll invite people to unmute when it's time to share
> - Please review and honor our community agreements
> - This session [is / is not] being recorded.
> - If you'd prefer not to be included, please keep your camera off and remain muted.
>
> Let's begin with a brief grounding breath together..."

## B. Inviting Participation

> "We're opening the space for reflections or questions now.
>
> If you feel called to share, please raise your hand or drop a short note in the chat.
>
> We'll invite one person at a time to unmute."

## C. Gentle Redirection Script

> "Thank you for sharing. I'm going to gently pause you there so we can hear from others as well."

---

## D. Boundary Script (if someone dominates or goes off-topic)

> "I appreciate your passion. I'm going to bring us back to the core theme so we can stay in collective coherence."

---

## E. Disruption Script (last-resort safety)

> "This space is guided by shared agreements.
>
> I'm going to mute/remove you now to protect the container."

## F. Closing Script

> "Thank you all for your presence, your honesty, and your care.
>
> This is a living experiment in what's possible when we gather with intention.
>
> If you'd like to:
> - Join future sessions
> - Propose a topic
> - Rewatch this conversation
> - Support the work
>
> You'll find links in the chat or on the session hub page.
