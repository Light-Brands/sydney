## What I'm Offering — Live with Syd

Beginning in February, I'll be hosting a series of recurring, co-creative live gatherings designed to support bioregional regeneration, grassroots resourcing, and collective coherence in a time of profound planetary transition.

These are not webinars.
They are living, relational spaces for learning, dialogue, and systems-building.

Each session weaves together:

- Education
- Storytelling
- Practical frameworks
- Open Q&A
- Emergent collaboration
- Collective sensemaking

They are an invitation into a shared field of inquiry, creativity, and grounded action.
