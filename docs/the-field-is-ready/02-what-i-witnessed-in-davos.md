The emotional texture of Davos was striking.

On one level, there was real optimism about regenerative tools / tech and new economic models. On another level, there was a palpable sense of existential urgency, social fragmentation, and civilizational instability.

## Regenerative Ecosystem Builders

What stood out most to me was how many regenerative ecosystem builders were present - and how strong the emphasis was on collaboration. There was a shared inquiry on how to move beyond isolated projects and into deeper coordination; how to become networks of networks; an ecosystem of ecosystems rather than siloed initiatives.

Examples include the Global Regenerative Development Alliance, and Global Alliance of ReGeneration (stewarded by Marc Buckley, Daniel Nicolai, Dina Baenninger, and others), Terramonia (nurtured by Peter Michel Heilmann and others), Gaia Commons (Silvana Raveane, etc.), Quorum1 (Hank Holiday, etc.), the World Systemic Forum Community (Anastasia Kalinina, Greta Pappa, Rudolf Hilti, etc.), Cities of Future (Mariia Koshkina and Konstantyn Chyzhyk), Holomovement (Rachel Morrison), and more.

## Biomimetic Governance

There was also demonstrable energy around creating biomimetic governance - designing institutions that reflect nature, including how our own bodies work - distributed intelligence, self-regulation, feedback loops, resilience through diversity, and coordinated autonomy.

## AI & Consciousness

I also encountered a growing number of initiatives exploring the implications of AI becoming conscious, with a strong emphasis on ethical alignment, safeguards, and governance to prevent dystopian outcomes and ensure emerging intelligence evolves in service of life.

## Bioregionalism & Flow Funding

When I spoke of bioregionalism, Flow Funding with [Kinship Earth](https://www.kinshipearth.org/), and the Planetary Party, I received strong, encouraging feedback. It felt timely and resonant for people - especially as an alternative pathway for coordination beyond nation-states and extractive economic systems.

> **Note:** Bioregionalism is the organizing around natural systems - watersheds, ecosystems, cultures, and foodsheds - rather than political borders. It offers a place-based way of coordinating care, resources, and governance that feels especially relevant in a time of global fragmentation. (This will be unpacked further in [Section 6](06-why-organize-bioregionally.md)).

## Mushroom Medicine & Paul Stamets

There was also a powerful blend of science, medicine, and mysticism within the space. In particular, Paul Stamets shared data on how mushrooms support:

- Consciousness expansion
- Addiction recovery
- Reducing partner violence
- Alzheimer's disease
- Ecological restoration, including saving the bees
- Immunity to future pandemics, e.g. bird flu

You can find the data on [Mushroom References](https://mushroomreferences.com/).

It was grounding to see evidence-based natural medicine woven into systemic solutions - balancing the policy talk and tech hype.

## Homo Universalis & the Regenaissance

Marc Buckley also brought his latest book, [Homo Universalis](https://homouniversalis.life/), into the field - a powerful articulation of the shift many of us are sensing, and what he and others describe as a **Regenaissance**: a collective remembering and reorientation toward life-centered ways of being. The book frames regeneration as a way of remembering how to belong to living systems again - moving beyond extractive civilization toward symbiosis and planetary intelligence. This perspective felt deeply aligned with the conversations unfolding throughout Davos.

## Language & Consciousness

Another recurring theme was language and consciousness. Across multiple talks and conversations, numerous participants surfaced how war logic lives deeply inside our everyday language, e.g.: *stakeholders, targets, campaigns.*

There exists a collective inquiry into how specific language shapes how individuals dominate, extract, influence, and control, sometimes without even realizing it.

## Two-Eyed Seeing

Thematically connected to language projection were the principles shared by Mindahi Bastida and Ryan (Ra) James Kemp: **two-eyed seeing** - the practice of holding both modern, scientific worldviews and Indigenous, relational, kinship-based ways of knowing at the same time. Not collapsing one into the other, or romanticizing either, but weaving them into a more complete way of sensing reality and designing systems.

This theme felt like a critical component - the key piece missing from many of the systems-change efforts evolving to shape the world today.

Two-eyed seeing offers both a philosophical and practical bridge for the Planetary Party. Rather than choosing between worlds, instead it promotes learning to stand in both at once: technological and relational, strategic and embodied, modern and Indigenous.

Through this lens, many long-standing disconnects make sense. Two-eyed seeing helps illuminate:

- Why technocratic solutions fail without relationship, trust, and care
- Why spiritual or cultural movements struggle without infrastructure and coordination
- Why governance systems collapse when divorced from land, body, and lived experience
- Why bioregionalism, regenerative finance, and cultural ceremony don't just complement one another - they belong together

What I've witnessed in spaces like Davos was not a lack of intelligence, capital, or innovation. It was a lack of integration. Two-eyed seeing solves this critical need by naming the capacity required to weave these worlds together without flattening either.

## Integrative Ecosystems

This integrative orientation - bridging inner and outer transformation - was echoed by ecosystems like [reState Foundation](https://restate.global/) and SuperSymmetry Institute - each working in different ways to design for coherence across governance, culture, economy, policy, and consciousness.
