The Planetary Party is not an organization or an ideology.

It is a living ecosystem actively building to coordinate regenerative action across bioregions - defined by natural ecosystems and shaped by shared ecology and culture (e.g.: watersheds, forests, mountain ranges, and food systems), rather than by political and/or economic borders.

At its core, the Planetary Party is a template for a civic and cultural infrastructure that supports a regenerative future; an operating system for humanity - envisioning and influenced by bioregional cooperation and with adjoining networks and systems of influences.

## What the Planetary Party Weaves Together

- **Bioregional Organizing** — Coordinating people locally around land, water, food systems, and culture
- **Regenerative Finance** — Deploying capital and resources directly towards community and ecosystem restoration
- **Cultural Events and Festivals** — Joyful attractor moments that leave a positive trace and attract resources for local, bioregional communities
- **Storytelling and Media** — Making visible what is working, what is struggling to persist, and what solutions are emerging
- **Governance Innovation** — Experimenting with decision-making models inspired by nature and living systems
- **Healing Arts and Collective Care** — Centering art, creativity, nervous-system health, trauma healing, and relational repair
- **Technology for Collective Intelligence** — Using data, mapping tools, and participatory platforms to tell the story of community health and support transparent, values-aligned decisions

## What the Protocol Enables Communities To Do

Ultimately, the Planetary Party Protocol is being midwifed to increase the capacities of communities to:

- Convene participatory civic assemblies (online + in person)
- Surface real needs and opportunities through stories, data, and mapping
- Co-design regenerative projects and place-based solutions
- Launch and steward Bioregional Flow Funds
- Make transparent, collective decisions around how resources flow
- Coordinate many kinds of value - money, time, skills, relationships, land, creativity, cultural wisdom, community care, and spiritual purpose - and align them toward shared regenerative goals
- Build tangible infrastructure (food, water, housing, energy, restoration)
- Track community health and impact over time
- Cultivate a set of regenerative capacities and resilience that can meet the emerging future with confidence and competence

## Gatherings as Magnetic Spaces

Like many festivals I have hosted, Planetary Parties will serve as magnetic spaces and gatherings - places to connect, to activate, to celebrate, and to leave a positive trace; to be a part of flourishing communities; to feel one's own innate generosity, to inspire creativity and agency. More becomes possible through these experiences - for individuals and groups.

These gatherings are also being designed to attract wealth holders who like to "party" - and who will witness the impact of their resources LIVE, in real time. In that sense, the ripple of impact becomes circular. Transparent, visual results fueled by the support of financial patrons - solving the often-cited concerns about lack of transparency around use of funds in charitable giving.

## Festival as Infrastructure

In the spirit of transformational festivals e.g.: Burning Man - where instead of burning down beautiful art - Planetary Parties will build lasting regenerative infrastructure and create environments to enable civic assembly, participatory grant making, showcasing of solutions to the crisis we are facing locally and globally. Again, similar to Burning Man, Planetary Parties will participate in the gift economy - inviting everyone to bring and share their unique gifts.

By serving the real needs of the host bioregions, each gathering offers learnings to be shared with other bioregions - thereby weaving together a bioregional learning network.
