## The Spark

My Planetary Party journey began with a personal question: **"How do we combine 'leave a positive trace' festivals with Bioregional Flow Funding?"**

I brought that question to Josie Watson ([Kinship Earth](https://www.kinshipearth.org/) board member), and founder of [Mycelial Law](https://myceliallaw.com/). Josie then introduced me to social architect, Juan Carlos Kaiten, who's been envisioning the Planetary Party for many years. We then convened a gathering of aligned visionaries at EcoTerra - an innovation lab and retreat center located in the Catskills of NY, as well as the HQ of [TerraLux Spatial Network](https://terra-lux.org/terraluxtech) - to prototype this in practice.

That gathering revealed the greater alignment around this mission and that those whom have downloaded their own versions and renditions of the Planetary Party continues to increase. Since this gathering, I've continued to meet people all over the world who share this vision, and who even call it the same thing! It's a field phenomenon.

## The Threads That Braided Together

This question braided together everything I had been working on:

- **[Kinship Earth](https://www.kinshipearth.org/)** — An organization promoting and practicing Bioregional Flow Funding - a trust-based approach to giving that involves deploying resources to place-based change-makers and bioregional organizing groups - inviting them to give away funds - however they see fit - to make the greatest impact possible on their local communities and ecosystems.

- **[Permatours](https://www.permatours.org/)** — A permaculture action and natural building network utilizing a traveling tour of events co-founded by Scotty Guzman and myself - kickstarted by a SEEDS regenerative crypto grant in 2021.

- **Community building, organizing, healing arts experiences, collective co-creation, and participatory governance** — My long-standing work across these domains.

## Core Stewards

Those primarily stewarding the Planetary Party Ecosystem at this early phase include:

- Eslerh Oreste
- Juan Carlos Kaiten (Social Alchemist, Planetary Party Vision Holder)
- Susanna Choe
- Josie Watson
- Nadim Hamdan (Regenerative Leadership Consultancy)
- Jenny Heinze
- Sheri Herndon
- Syd Harvey Griffith

## Aligned Organizations We've Been Weaving With

- **[The Pivot Earth](https://thepivot.earth/)** — A women-led ecosystem weaver supporting bioregional regeneration by facilitating flows of trust, knowledge, capital, and care across people and projects

- **[Holomovement](https://www.holomovement.net/)** — A "movement of movements" and global community oriented around conscious collaboration and serving the good of the whole

- **Nalu'ea Living Trust** — A living-trust-based stewardship vehicle (land/asset trust) oriented toward long-term care and intergenerational stewardship

- **Bioregional Embassy** — A diplomatic agency "in service to life" bridging governance, finance, and culture through the intelligence of place to support regenerative cooperation and stewardship

- **Micelio Media** — A storytelling studio creating film and multimedia that amplifies bioregional voices, culture, and Earth-honoring narratives

- **[Mycelial Law](https://myceliallaw.com/)** — An Earth-law practice exploring biomimicry-inspired legal structures and commons/trust architectures in service of life-centered governance and regenerative economies

- **[Kinship Earth](https://www.kinshipearth.org/)** — A trust-based philanthropy advancing bioregional regeneration by funding grassroots leaders and bioregional organizing through unrestricted Flow Funding grants

- **[Permatours](https://www.permatours.org/)** — A learn-by-doing permaculture action network rooted in the Northeast bioregion, co-creating hands-on projects and events that build resilience, skills, and regenerative infrastructure

We've all been in the field sharing the vision, gathering feedback, sensing reactions, and refining the narrative and protocol.

Now, the governance models are emerging that will support wider co-creation, including regular, open calls for aligned people and groups to join and shape what this becomes.
