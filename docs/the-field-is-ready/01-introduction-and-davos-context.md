## The Field Is Ready

*My Reflections post Davos / The World Economic Forum & an Invitation into the Planetary Party Ecosystem*

**As the old world doubles down, a different path is being affirmed - one of joy, collaboration, and systems that serve life.**

I recently returned home to Vermont from Davos, Switzerland - a place that holds a strange gravity in the global imagination.

For those unfamiliar: Davos is best known as the host city of the World Economic Forum (WEF), an annual gathering that brings together heads of state, individual and sovereign wealth, corporate leaders, investors, technologists, visionaries, and policy-makers to discuss the future of our world.

It has a deeply mixed reputation - and for good reason.

On one hand, it's a concentrated field of power, capital, influence, and decision-making. On the other hand, it's often criticized as a symbol of elite capture: a place where people who most benefit from the current system gather behind closed doors while the world outside continues to fracture.

## The Current Moment

Donald Trump was in town. Wars and genocides are unfolding in real time. Authoritarianism is rising across multiple countries. AI is advancing faster than our collective ability to govern it ethically or wisely. Climate systems are becoming more volatile and unpredictable - with extreme weather, ecosystem collapse, and food insecurity accelerating globally.

And in the U.S., we are not "sliding into" fascism. It is here.

Immigrant communities and naturalized citizens are living under escalating terror as ICE raids, kidnappings, and deportations intensify. But it's no longer only immigrant communities. Many U.S. citizens - including white Americans who have historically felt buffered from state violence - are now feeling what communities of color have endured for decades: the social contract is breaking, civil liberties are eroding, people are disappearing, and psychological safety is dissolving in real time.

## What Davos Sharpened

Being physically present in the WEF field - while also carrying deep relationships with grassroots organizers, bioregional leaders, and frontline communities - was emotionally intense.

It sharpened something in me: Not just grief and anger - but a deep, embodied urgency to stop waiting for the "right moment" or the "perfect container" to begin opening up what myself and my fellow trusted collaborators have been building: A response to this moment in history we are calling **"The Planetary Party."**

I'll expand more later, but for now I'll share this: The Planetary Party is a cultural orientation and an emerging coordination framework - a way that people are gathering in joy, relationship, and shared purpose; A way to respond to planetary breakdown with regenerative action. It's not a single organization or ideology, but a pattern that's been quietly taking shape across communities.
