The Protocol follows a 5-part rhythm:

## 1. Sense — Observe & Listen to Place

*Entering into relationship*

Circles, assemblies, rituals, and gatherings create space for deep listening - to land, people, histories, and futures. Communities attune to what is alive, what is needed, and what is asking for care, before moving into action.

## 2. See — Mapping & Meaning-Making Together

*Making the whole visible*

Stories, culture, ecological knowledge, and shared data come together through dialogue and collective intelligence. Communities make meaning together, revealing patterns, leverage points, and possibilities that no single actor can see alone.

Shared maps support clarity, transparency, and wiser collective decisions.

## 3. Flow — Choosing Wisely & Moving Resources Like Water

*From insight to action*

Resources move toward what communities have named as most vital. Local Flow Funds and multi-capital mechanisms support initiatives through trust, relationship, and stewardship - practicing real governance through choice, accountability, and feedback.

## 4. Celebrate — Convergence & Activation

*Where culture becomes coordination*

Festivals, ceremonies, and civic gatherings bring people together to activate projects, seed funding, and commit to shared action. Celebration becomes a coordination technology - building trust, strengthening relationships, and turning insight into momentum.

## 5. Regenerate — Learning as a Living Spiral

*Integration and renewal*

Communities track impact, harvest lessons, and reinvest what's learned into the next cycle. What works is strengthened, what doesn't is adapted, and capacity deepens over time.
