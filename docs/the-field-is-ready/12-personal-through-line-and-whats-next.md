## Moving Between Worlds

The last few months of my life have felt like jumping between parallel worlds:

- **Mexico** — Weaving with bioregional communities and grassroots changemakers
- **NYC Climate Week** — Interfacing with climate capital / funds, artists, and technologists
- **Guatemala** — Attending the Prophetic DAO incubator re: ways to decentralize decision making and develop community currencies that rewards Earth-centered projects and behaviors
- **The World Economic Forum and the World Systemic Forum** — Global power + regenerative and systemic-healing focused convergence

I've been moving between worlds of wealth and influence and worlds of grassroots community - and carrying insights back into The Planetary Party, Kinship Earth, Permatours, and Unified Sanctuaries (a regenerative land project I'm co-creating in the Northeast). As permaculturists and ecophilosophers, the place where two ecosystems come together is the place of greatest fertility.

## Opening the Field

And now, I'm opening the field more intentionally.

Starting in **March 2026**, I'll be going LIVE, streaming the following discussions:

### Regenerative Capital Flows Education & Ideation

Learning and discussion on the many paths to unlocking capital for local, bioregional communities, e.g. Bioregional Flow Funding, carbon / biodiversity credit market, data collection, regenerative cryptocurrencies and digital assets, green bonds, social impact investment, grants, commitment pooling, co-operative structures / resource pooling, etc.

### Planetary Party Collaboration & Ecosystem Building

Guild-building, governance co-creation, bioregional community weaving, Q&As, etc.

### Unified Sanctuaries Development & Landing

A land-based project I am co-creating in the Northeast (likely Vermont) - a home for innovation, healing, permaculture, the bioregional movement, and the Planetary Party; a blueprint for regenerative communities shifting from private ownership to collective stewardship.

### Heart Sharing

A space to slow down, be witnessed, and share what we're carrying - grounding this work in care, presence, and collective integration. Trained facilitators will be invited to help hold these circles so that our coordination and creation are supported by emotional and relational coherence.

**The solutions are already distributed across the collective. Our work is to convene, weave, and steward.**
