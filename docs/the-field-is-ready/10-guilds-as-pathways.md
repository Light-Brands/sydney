We are organizing within a Guild ecosystem - serving as a living pathway for different people and organizations to co-create. The Guilds that have emerged thus far include:

## The Guild Ecosystem

| Guild | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Living Systems & Solutions** | Land, food, water, energy, restoration |
| **Capacity Building** | Training, healing, leadership development |
| **Regenerative Capital Flows** | Flow Funds, investment, multi-capital design |
| **Governance** | Participatory systems and collective decision making methods, legal scaffolding |
| **Events** | Gatherings, festivals, cultural activations |
| **Storytelling** | Media, myth, narrative infrastructure |
| **Bioregional Intelligence Dashboard Process** | Sense-making, mapping, data collection, impact visibility |
| **Tech** | Regenerative tooling and interoperability support |
| **Guild Ecosystem Weaving** | Cross-guild synergy and coordination |

## Ecosystem Weaving

The Guild Ecosystem Weaving function deserves special attention: synergy reveals an emergent paradigm in which reality itself organizes toward higher-order coherence rather than being engineered from the top down.
