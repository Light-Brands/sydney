At this early stage, [Kinship Earth](https://www.kinshipearth.org/) is serving as the primary philanthropic backbone for Bioregional Flow Funding within the Planetary Party Protocol, while the broader ecosystem of guilds is evolving the cultural, governance, and coordination layers that will support long-term bioregional regeneration.
