# Live with Syd -- Regenerative Capital Flows Overview

**Date:** February 26, 2026
**Series:** Monday -- Regenerative Capital Flows
**Session Type:** Foundational Overview
**Purpose:** Introduce the landscape of regenerative capital flows so participants understand the premise and basics of each avenue. Future sessions will go deeper into each one.

---

## Opening Frame

The way capital moves in the world today was not designed for communities, ecosystems, or the living systems we depend on. It was designed for extraction, accumulation, and centralized control.

Regenerative capital flows are about redesigning how resources move -- so that capital serves life, not the other way around.

Today we're going to walk through a landscape of different kinds of capital flows that communities can access, steward, and build with. This is a first pass -- an overview. In future sessions we'll go deep into each of these. The goal today is for everyone to walk away understanding the basics of what's available, what makes each approach distinct, and how they might weave together.

## 1. Flow Funding

### What It Is

A participatory, trust-based grantmaking model where unrestricted funds are moved directly to trusted community leaders -- no applications, minimal reporting, maximum trust.

### How It Works

1. **Identify** -- Trusted community leaders are identified through deep relational networks, Flow Fund Advisors, and existing Flow Funders
2. **Deploy** -- Unrestricted funds go directly to those leaders; they decide how, when, and where capital moves based on what their community actually needs
3. **Report** -- Lightweight, story-based accountability replaces heavy compliance paperwork
4. **Recommend** -- Flow Funders nominate the next cohort of recipients, creating a self-perpetuating decentralized network

### What Makes It Different

- **Invitation-driven**, not application-driven
- **Community-controlled** decisions, not foundation-controlled
- **Organized by bioregions** (natural ecosystems and culture), not political boundaries
- **Trust and relationship** govern the process, not bureaucracy and compliance

### Key Context

- Pioneered by Marian Rockefeller Weber in the early 1990s
- Kinship Earth has raised $800K+ since 2024 and deployed $370K+ to 23 Flow Funders across 12+ bioregions globally
- Real outcomes: freeze dryers for food sovereignty on reservations, protection of sacred waters in Minnesota, family food security programs, women-led permaculture gardens in Ecuador, landscape hubs across Cascadia

### Real-World Examples

- **Kinship Earth's Cascadia Flow Fund** -- Flow Funders in the Pacific Northwest have used unrestricted capital to fund landscape-scale permaculture installations, mobile food preservation units, and Indigenous-led water protection ceremonies
- **Jamaica Bioregional Flow Fund** -- Flow Funders in Jamaica are directing capital toward community food forests, youth empowerment programs, and disaster resilience planning rooted in local ecological knowledge
- **Ecuador Flow Funders** -- women leaders in rural Ecuador received Flow Funding to establish permaculture gardens and seed-saving programs, building food sovereignty without having to navigate NGO bureaucracy
- **Northeast Turtle Island** -- Flow Funders in the northeastern U.S. and Canada are supporting Indigenous land-back initiatives and food security programs through direct, unrestricted funding

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Sustainability of funding** -- Flow Funding relies on continuous fundraising to keep the pipeline flowing; without endowment-level capital, it's vulnerable to donor fatigue or economic downturns
- **Trust can be exclusionary** -- invitation-based models, while powerful, can inadvertently create in-groups and out-groups; communities not yet connected to the relational network may be left out
- **Accountability without bureaucracy** -- the light-touch reporting model is one of Flow Funding's strengths, but some funders and supporters want more evidence of impact, creating tension between trust and transparency
- **Scale limitations** -- individual Flow Fund awards are typically small ($5K-25K); transformative for individuals but may not meet the scale of infrastructure or systemic challenges communities face
- **Relational burden** -- the model depends heavily on the emotional and relational labor of Flow Fund Advisors and community leaders, which is often uncompensated or undercompensated

---

## 2. Bioregional Flow Funding

### What It Is

Flow Funding organized at the bioregional scale -- autonomous, place-based Flow Funds created by and for specific bioregional communities, with support from organizations like Kinship Earth serving as backbone infrastructure.

### How It Differs from Standard Flow Funding

- **Place-rooted** -- organized around watersheds, ecosystems, and cultural landscapes rather than political boundaries
- **Locally governed** -- each bioregional Flow Fund is autonomous, not controlled by a central body
- **Self-perpetuating** -- designed so communities can launch and sustain their own funds without ongoing dependency

### The Vision

A global network of bioregional Flow Funds -- each rooted in place, governed by trust, and connected to a shared learning community. Kinship Earth's role is to provide legal, educational, and relational backbone -- not to be the center.

### Key Points to Share

- Active bioregions: Cascadia, Northeast Turtle Island, Greater Tkaronto, Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico, East Africa
- Kinship Earth is developing a free, open-source Bioregional Flow Funding Playbook to help any community launch their own
- The goal: 20+ bioregional Flow Funds created within 5 years

### Real-World Examples

- **Cascadia Bioregional Flow Fund** -- one of the most developed bioregional funds, supporting a network of regenerative land projects, Indigenous-led stewardship, and community food systems across the Pacific Northwest watershed
- **Greater Tkaronto Bioregional Flow Fund** -- centered in the Toronto bioregion, funding urban-rural regenerative connections, Indigenous land stewardship, and community resilience projects
- **East Africa Bioregional Flow Fund** -- supporting community-led regeneration in Kenya and neighboring regions, connecting bioregional funding models with existing community organizing traditions like chamas (savings circles)

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Autonomy vs. coherence** -- each bioregional fund is self-governing, which is a strength, but it also means there's no guarantee of consistent quality, equity, or accountability across the network
- **Bioregional boundaries are contested** -- defining a bioregion is not always straightforward; overlapping cultural, ecological, and political geographies can create disputes about who belongs and who decides
- **Dependency on backbone organizations** -- while the vision is autonomy, in practice many bioregional funds still depend on Kinship Earth or similar organizations for legal infrastructure, fundraising, and credibility
- **Equity across bioregions** -- wealthier or better-connected bioregions may attract more funding, reproducing the geographic inequities the model is designed to address
- **Cultural translation** -- the Flow Funding model was developed in a North American context; adapting it for bioregions with different governance traditions, legal frameworks, and cultural norms requires genuine co-design, not just replication

## 3. Traditional & Institutional Philanthropy

### What It Is

The conventional philanthropic system -- foundations, donor-advised funds (DAFs), family offices, and large institutional grantmakers distributing capital through formal application and reporting processes.

### The Basics

- **Foundations** hold endowments and distribute a portion annually (typically only ~5-7% of assets)
- **Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs)** allow individuals to make tax-deductible contributions to a fund, then recommend grants over time -- there is no legal requirement to distribute, so billions sit idle
- **Family Offices** manage wealth for high-net-worth families; some are moving toward values-aligned giving
- **Institutional Grantmakers** (Ford, Rockefeller, MacArthur, etc.) deploy large grants, often with significant compliance requirements

### The Structural Problems

- **93% of foundation assets locked in endowments** -- only ~7% flows out annually
- **Application burden** -- grassroots leaders spend enormous time writing proposals instead of doing the work
- **Top-down control** -- foundations decide what communities should prioritize
- **Exclusion** -- Indigenous peoples protect 80% of global biodiversity but receive less than 1% of climate finance
- **Siloed** -- organized by issue area (health, education, environment) rather than how communities actually live

### Why It Still Matters

- It's where the vast majority of philanthropic capital currently sits
- Reforming it from within -- through trust-based philanthropy, participatory grantmaking, and spend-down commitments -- can unlock enormous resources
- Some foundations are beginning to shift: MacKenzie Scott's direct giving, the Decolonizing Wealth movement, trust-based philanthropy networks
- Educating donors and foundations on flow funding is part of the work

### Real-World Examples

- **MacKenzie Scott** -- has given away over $17 billion through direct, unrestricted gifts to organizations serving underrepresented communities, bypassing the traditional application process entirely and trusting organizations to allocate funds as they see fit
- **The NDN Collective** -- an Indigenous-led organization that received $12M from the Bush Foundation and uses it to fund Indigenous power-building, land defense, and regenerative economic development across multiple tribal nations
- **The Decolonizing Wealth Project (Edgar Villanueva)** -- actively pushing philanthropy to confront its colonial roots and redistribute wealth through participatory, community-led models; the associated Liberated Capital fund moved $25M to BIPOC-led organizations
- **Thousand Currents** -- a foundation that provides long-term, flexible funding to grassroots groups in the Global South working on food sovereignty, climate justice, and alternative economies
- **First Nations Development Institute** -- has distributed over $50 million in grants to Native-led community projects including food systems, land stewardship, and economic development

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Power hoarding** -- even progressive foundations maintain structural power over who gets funded and how; participatory grantmaking is growing but still rare
- **The endowment trap** -- foundations are legally required to distribute only ~5% annually; the remaining 95% is often invested in the very extractive industries that cause the problems philanthropy claims to solve
- **Application burden as gatekeeping** -- the proposal-writing process systematically favors organizations with grant writers, development staff, and institutional knowledge, excluding grassroots and Indigenous-led groups
- **Short funding cycles** -- most grants are 1-3 years, but community regeneration requires decades; this mismatch forces organizations into perpetual fundraising survival mode
- **Strings attached** -- even when grants are labeled "unrestricted," funders often exert informal influence through check-in calls, site visits, and the implicit threat of not renewing
- **Tax shelter dynamics** -- DAFs in particular have become vehicles for wealthy individuals to claim tax deductions immediately while distributing funds slowly or never; over $230 billion sits in DAFs with no timeline for distribution

## 4. Impact Investment

### What It Is

Investments made with the intention of generating both financial returns and measurable social or environmental impact. It sits between traditional philanthropy (no return expected) and conventional investing (maximize financial return).

### The Spectrum

```
Pure Philanthropy <----> Concessionary Returns <----> Market-Rate Returns <----> Conventional Investing
(grants, no return)      (below-market, impact-first)  (competitive returns + impact)  (profit-only)
```

### Key Concepts

- **Impact-First** -- accepts lower financial returns in exchange for deeper impact
- **Finance-First** -- seeks market-rate returns while screening for social/environmental outcomes
- **Blended Finance** -- uses philanthropic or public capital to reduce risk and attract private investment into regenerative projects
- **Patient Capital** -- longer time horizons that match the pace of ecological and community regeneration (not quarterly returns)
- **Catalytic Capital** -- flexible, risk-tolerant capital that fills gaps the market won't -- often the first money in

### Blended Finance -- A Closer Look

Blended finance is one of the most important mechanisms for getting private capital to flow toward projects that the market would otherwise consider too risky or too small. Here's how it works in practice:

A philanthropic foundation, development finance institution, or government agency puts up the **first-loss capital** -- meaning they agree to absorb the initial losses if a project underperforms. This de-risks the investment for private investors (banks, pension funds, family offices), who can then come in at a higher, more protected tier of the capital stack. The result is that projects that would never attract private money on their own -- regenerative agriculture, community-owned energy, Indigenous land stewardship -- can suddenly access significantly larger pools of capital.

**The typical structure:**

1. **Concessionary layer** -- grants or below-market loans from philanthropic or public sources (absorbs first losses)
2. **Mezzanine layer** -- mission-aligned investors accepting moderate risk for moderate returns
3. **Senior layer** -- conventional private investors who are now protected by the layers below them

**Why it matters for communities:** Blended finance can unlock 3-10x more capital than philanthropic dollars alone. A $1M grant used as first-loss capital in a blended structure might attract $5-10M in total investment. For communities trying to fund large infrastructure -- land acquisition, renewable energy systems, food processing facilities -- this multiplier effect can be the difference between a project happening and not.

**Example:** The Global Fund for Coral Reefs uses blended finance to channel capital to coastal communities. Public and philanthropic money absorbs the risk, which brings in private investors to fund reef restoration and sustainable coastal livelihoods. Convergence, a global network for blended finance, has tracked over $200 billion in blended finance transactions, though very little has reached community scale -- which is both the challenge and the opportunity.

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Complexity and cost** -- blended finance structures require legal, financial, and administrative expertise that most grassroots organizations don't have access to; structuring a deal can cost $100K-500K+ in legal and advisory fees before a single dollar flows
- **Scale bias** -- most blended finance deals are designed for $10M+ projects, making them inaccessible to community-scale work without intermediaries who can aggregate smaller projects
- **Power asymmetry** -- private investors in the senior tranche often set the terms, timelines, and reporting requirements, which can override community priorities
- **Mission drift** -- the need to attract private capital can push projects toward market logic (faster returns, quantifiable outcomes) and away from the slower, relational, and harder-to-measure work of regeneration
- **Greenwashing risk** -- the "blended" label can be used to make conventional investments look more impactful than they are
- **Who absorbs the risk?** -- first-loss capital often comes from public or philanthropic sources, meaning communities and taxpayers bear the downside while private investors capture the upside

### Relevance for Communities

- Can fund land acquisition, regenerative agriculture, community housing, renewable energy
- Growing interest from family offices and wealth managers in "beyond ESG" impact
- Challenge: most impact investment still flows to large organizations, not grassroots; terms and structures often don't fit community-scale projects
- Opportunity: designing investment vehicles that are community-governed and regenerative by design

### Real-World Examples

- **RSF Social Finance** -- a San Francisco-based social enterprise that offers loans, grants, and investments specifically for regenerative food and agriculture, education, and ecological stewardship; they practice transparent pricing where borrowers and investors meet and collectively set interest rates
- **Iroquois Valley Farmland REIT** -- a public benefit corporation that provides land access to organic and regenerative farmers through long-term leases and mortgage financing; investors buy shares and the capital goes directly to keeping farmland in regenerative production
- **The Kataly Foundation** -- committed to spending down its entire endowment to fund reparative and regenerative work, including land return, cooperative enterprise, and community-controlled investment funds
- **Seed Commons** -- a national network of locally-rooted, non-extractive loan funds that provide financing to worker-owned cooperatives; they don't require personal guarantees or collateral, and repayment is tied to business performance
- **The Akola Project** in Uganda -- accessed impact investment to build a social enterprise employing women in jewelry and shea butter production; the investment funded training, market access, and fair-wage infrastructure

## 5. Green Bonds & Bonds

### What It Is

Bonds are debt instruments -- you lend money to an entity (government, municipality, corporation) and they pay you back with interest over time. Green bonds are bonds specifically earmarked to fund environmentally beneficial projects.

### Types Relevant to Regeneration

- **Green Bonds** -- fund climate and environmental projects (renewable energy, clean water, sustainable land use)
- **Social Bonds** -- fund projects with positive social outcomes (affordable housing, food access, healthcare)
- **Sustainability Bonds** -- combine green and social objectives
- **Community Development Bonds** -- issued by community development financial institutions (CDFIs) to fund local projects
- **Municipal Bonds** -- issued by local governments; can fund public infrastructure, parks, water systems

### Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) -- A Closer Look

CDFIs are specialized financial institutions -- credit unions, loan funds, banks, and venture capital funds -- whose primary mission is to serve low-income communities and communities that conventional banks have historically excluded or underserved.

**How they work:**

1. **Capitalization** -- CDFIs raise capital from a mix of sources: federal government programs (the CDFI Fund at the U.S. Treasury), banks meeting Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) obligations, foundations making program-related investments (PRIs), and individual investors seeking community impact
2. **Lending** -- They provide affordable loans, credit, and financial services to people and projects that traditional banks won't touch -- small businesses, affordable housing developments, community facilities, and regenerative agriculture
3. **Technical assistance** -- Beyond lending, CDFIs often provide business planning, financial literacy, and capacity-building support to borrowers
4. **Reinvestment** -- Loan repayments recycle back into the fund, creating a revolving pool of community capital

**Why they matter for regeneration:** CDFIs are one of the most proven vehicles for getting capital into underserved communities at a scale that matters. There are over 1,400 certified CDFIs in the U.S. managing over $450 billion in assets. They can issue bonds, make loans, and provide technical assistance -- all rooted in a community-serving mission. For land-based communities, CDFIs can be a critical bridge between philanthropic seed funding and the larger capital needed for land acquisition, infrastructure, and enterprise development.

### How to Access Different Kinds of Bonds

Accessing bonds is not the same as accessing grants -- each type has specific requirements, gatekeepers, and thresholds:

**Green Bonds:**
- **Who issues them:** Governments, corporations, municipalities, development banks
- **How to access as an investor:** Through brokerage accounts, bond funds, or green bond ETFs (exchange-traded funds); minimum investments vary from ~$1,000 for bond funds to $5,000-10,000+ for individual bonds
- **How to access as a project seeking funding:** Your project must meet green bond framework criteria (typically aligned with the Green Bond Principles from ICMA); you need verified environmental impact data, a use-of-proceeds framework, and usually an external review or certification; most green bonds require projects at $10M+ scale
- **What's required:** Environmental impact assessment, third-party verification, ongoing reporting on use of proceeds and impact

**Social Bonds:**
- **Similar access pathway to green bonds**, but focused on social outcomes (housing, healthcare, food access, education)
- **Requires:** Clearly defined target populations, measurable social impact metrics, and a use-of-proceeds framework reviewed by an external party

**Municipal Bonds:**
- **Who issues them:** City, county, and state governments
- **How communities can access:** Advocate for municipal bond issuances that fund regenerative infrastructure; participate in public comment and planning processes; work with local government to include regenerative projects in bond measures
- **What's required:** Political will, community organizing, a clear project scope, and usually a public vote (for general obligation bonds) or a revenue stream to back the bond (for revenue bonds)
- **Entry point:** Attend city council and county budget meetings; build relationships with municipal finance officers; partner with organizations experienced in municipal advocacy

**Community Development Bonds (via CDFIs):**
- **Who issues them:** Certified CDFIs
- **How to access as an investor:** Invest directly through CDFI note programs (e.g., Calvert Impact Capital community investment notes, minimum $20); some CDFIs offer community investment certificates with minimums as low as $500-1,000
- **How to access as a borrower:** Apply directly to a CDFI serving your region; demonstrate community impact, a viable business/project plan, and capacity to repay; CDFIs are more flexible than traditional banks but still require basic financial documentation
- **What's required:** A relationship with or proximity to a CDFI; project readiness; some CDFIs require matching funds or demonstrated community support

**The Data and Pooling Challenge:**
- Many bond frameworks -- especially green and social bonds -- require quantified impact data that individual communities or small projects may not have on their own
- **Pooling is often necessary:** Multiple land-based communities may need to aggregate their ecological data (carbon sequestered, acres restored, biodiversity outcomes) in order to meet the scale thresholds that bond issuers and verifiers require
- **Example:** A single 200-acre regenerative farm may not generate enough verified carbon data to back a green bond, but a network of 50 farms across a bioregion pooling their data might collectively demonstrate the impact needed to attract bond financing
- Organizations like Neighborly, Community Reinvestment Fund (CRF), and various CDFI networks are building infrastructure to help smaller projects aggregate and access bond markets

### Key Points

- The global green bond market has grown to over $4 trillion cumulative issuance
- These are primarily institutional tools -- but municipalities and CDFIs can issue smaller-scale bonds accessible to community-level projects
- Challenge: most green bonds fund large-scale corporate or government projects, not grassroots regeneration
- Opportunity: community-scale bond programs, citizen-backed bonds, and regenerative bond frameworks that direct capital to bioregional projects

### Real-World Examples

- **DC Water Environmental Impact Bond** -- the District of Columbia issued the first environmental impact bond in 2016 to fund green infrastructure for stormwater management; investor returns were tied to actual performance of the green infrastructure, creating a model where outcomes drive financial returns
- **Craft3 (Pacific Northwest CDFI)** -- issues community development bonds and has deployed over $900 million in loans to small businesses, affordable housing, and clean energy projects across Oregon and Washington; their borrowers include regenerative farms, tribal enterprises, and rural cooperatives
- **Self-Help Credit Union (North Carolina)** -- one of the largest CDFIs in the U.S., has provided over $10 billion in financing for affordable housing, small businesses, and community facilities in underserved communities
- **The City of San Francisco's Green Bond** -- issued municipal green bonds to fund seismic retrofitting, clean energy, and sustainable water infrastructure; accessible to residents through bond fund purchases
- **Neighborly** -- a platform that has worked to make municipal bonds more accessible to everyday citizens, including bonds funding parks, libraries, and community infrastructure in underserved neighborhoods
- **Native CDFI Network** -- a network of CDFIs specifically serving Native American communities; Native CDFIs like Four Bands Community Fund (Cheyenne River Reservation) and Lakota Funds have provided critical capital for tribal enterprises, housing, and food sovereignty projects where mainstream banks won't lend

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Accessibility gap** -- bonds remain primarily institutional tools; most community members and grassroots organizations don't know how to access, issue, or advocate for them
- **Scale mismatch** -- the minimum scale for bond issuance typically starts at $1-5M, far above what most community projects need; aggregation is possible but adds complexity and requires coordination infrastructure
- **Technical barriers** -- issuing bonds requires legal counsel, underwriting, credit ratings, and regulatory compliance that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars; these costs are often prohibitive for community-scale issuers
- **Data requirements** -- especially for green and social bonds, the verification and reporting requirements demand ongoing data collection that small organizations may not have capacity for
- **Risk of displacement** -- bond-funded infrastructure improvements (parks, transit, water systems) can increase property values and lead to gentrification, displacing the very communities the bonds were meant to serve
- **CDFI limitations** -- while CDFIs are mission-driven, they still operate within the debt paradigm; communities must repay loans, and default risk falls on the community; CDFIs are also chronically undercapitalized relative to the demand they serve
- **Interest rate environment** -- rising interest rates make bonds more expensive to issue and less attractive for small-scale projects
- **Greenwashing in green bonds** -- not all "green" bonds deliver meaningful environmental outcomes; the lack of standardized definitions means the label can be applied loosely

### Why This Matters for Us

- Bonds can fund the kind of physical infrastructure communities need -- water systems, renewable energy, regenerative agriculture facilities, community land trusts
- Understanding bonds helps communities advocate for municipal and regional investment in regeneration
- New models are emerging that blend bond structures with community ownership

## 6. Regenerative Crypto & Community Currencies

### What It Is

Digital and local currencies, tokens, and decentralized financial tools designed to serve community coordination, local exchange, and regenerative outcomes -- rather than speculation.

### Key Concepts

- **Community Currencies** -- local or bioregional currencies that keep value circulating within a community (digital or physical)
- **Utility Tokens** -- digital tokens exchangeable for goods, services, or access within a specific community or network
- **Governance Tokens** -- tokens that grant decision-making power (voting rights) within a community or protocol
- **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)** -- community-governed treasuries and decision-making structures coordinated through smart contracts
- **ReFi (Regenerative Finance)** -- a movement within crypto/Web3 specifically focused on funding ecological and social regeneration

### Design Principles That Matter

- **Separation of economic and governance power** -- who can trade and who can vote should not be the same thing (to prevent plutocracy)
- **Anti-speculation safeguards** -- mechanisms that prevent hoarding and ensure currency circulates
- **Place-based design** -- currencies and tokens rooted in specific bioregions, not abstract global markets
- **Contribution-based** -- governance power earned through participation and stewardship, not purchased

### Real-World Examples

- Permatours is developing a dual-token system: Utility Tokens for marketplace exchange and Voice Tokens (non-transferable) for governance
- Grassroots Economics in Kenya has deployed community inclusion currencies serving tens of thousands of users
- Celo, Regen Network, and Toucan Protocol are building ReFi infrastructure
- Local exchange trading systems (LETS) and timebanks have been operating for decades as non-digital community currencies

### Real-World Examples

- **Grassroots Economics (Kenya)** -- has deployed community inclusion currencies (CICs) in informal settlements and rural communities across Kenya, serving tens of thousands of users; community members trade goods and services using a locally issued digital currency that keeps value circulating locally even when national currency is scarce
- **Bancor & Sarafu Network** -- the Sarafu network in Kenya used bonding curve technology to create community currencies that automatically adjust to local trade activity, allowing communities to create their own liquidity without depending on external capital
- **BerkShares (Massachusetts)** -- a local currency circulating in the Berkshire region since 2006; accepted by over 400 businesses; printed notes are purchased at local banks and used to encourage local spending
- **Celo & Kolektivo** -- Kolektivo built a regenerative finance platform on the Celo blockchain enabling communities in Curaçao to create local currencies backed by community-verified ecological assets
- **Seeds (regenerative currency)** -- a digital currency designed for regenerative communities, where value creation is tied to ecological and social contributions rather than speculation; used by a global network of ecovillages and regenerative projects

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Regulatory risk** -- governments and financial regulators may classify community tokens as securities, subjecting them to compliance requirements that are expensive and complex for grassroots projects; this legal gray area creates uncertainty
- **Technical barrier** -- blockchain and crypto tools still require significant technical literacy; many community members, especially elders and those without smartphones, are excluded
- **Speculation undermines purpose** -- even well-designed tokens can attract speculators who distort the local economy; anti-speculation mechanisms exist but are not foolproof
- **Volatility** -- crypto-based community currencies can experience price swings that make them unreliable for daily use
- **Energy and environmental costs** -- some blockchain networks have significant energy footprints, creating tension with regenerative values (though many newer networks like Celo are low-energy)
- **Hype-to-substance ratio** -- the ReFi space has attracted significant hype and venture capital, but many projects have failed to deliver lasting community benefit; distinguishing genuine community tools from tech solutionism is an ongoing challenge
- **Wealth reproduction** -- even in DAOs, those with more tokens often have more influence; without careful governance design, crypto tools can reproduce the same wealth-based power dynamics they claim to disrupt

### Why This Matters

- Communities can create their own mediums of exchange that reflect their values
- Governance tokens can distribute decision-making power beyond those with money
- These tools can work alongside -- not replace -- national currencies
- The tech is maturing, but the design choices matter more than the technology

## 7. Community-Managed Assets & Local Exchange

### What It Is

The broader category of resources, tools, and systems that communities can directly manage, trade, and exchange with -- beyond currency. These are the tangible and intangible assets that communities already hold.

### Types of Community Assets

- **Land and natural resources** -- held through community land trusts, cooperatives, or commons frameworks
- **Community-owned enterprises** -- cooperatives, worker-owned businesses, community-owned renewable energy
- **Shared infrastructure** -- tool libraries, seed banks, community kitchens, maker spaces, shared vehicles
- **Knowledge and skills** -- training programs, apprenticeships, traditional ecological knowledge
- **Social capital** -- trust networks, mutual aid systems, relationship infrastructure
- **Time and labor** -- timebanks and labor exchanges where hours of work are the unit of value

### Key Frameworks

- **Commons-based governance** -- managing shared resources through community agreements rather than private ownership or government control
- **Cooperative ownership** -- democratic ownership models (worker co-ops, consumer co-ops, housing co-ops, multi-stakeholder co-ops)
- **Community Land Trusts (CLTs)** -- permanently removing land from speculative markets and holding it in trust for community benefit
- **Mutual aid** -- reciprocal resource sharing based on solidarity, not charity

### Real-World Examples

- **Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative (Boston)** -- one of the first community land trusts in the U.S., established in a historically disinvested Black and Latino neighborhood; the community used eminent domain -- a power typically reserved for governments -- to acquire vacant lots and develop permanently affordable housing, community gardens, and a greenhouse; the land is held in trust so it can never be sold to speculators
- **Cooperation Jackson (Mississippi)** -- building a solidarity economy in Jackson, Mississippi, centered on a network of worker-owned cooperatives, a community land trust, and urban farming; their vision includes a fabrication lab, cooperative grocery store, and community-controlled renewable energy
- **Mondragon Corporation (Basque Country, Spain)** -- the world's largest worker-owned cooperative, with over 80,000 worker-owners across manufacturing, retail, finance, and education; demonstrates that cooperative models can operate at significant scale while maintaining democratic governance
- **Cobscook Community Learning Center (Maine)** -- a rural community hub that operates a tool library, community kitchen, and skills-sharing network; they created a timebank where members exchange hours of labor for services, from carpentry to childcare
- **Earthseed Land Cooperative (North Carolina)** -- a Black-led community land trust focused on building collective ownership of land for regenerative agriculture, housing, and cultural preservation in the rural South

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Legal complexity** -- setting up community land trusts, cooperatives, and commons governance structures requires specialized legal knowledge and often doesn't fit neatly into existing legal frameworks
- **Slow and labor-intensive** -- building genuine community ownership takes years of organizing, trust-building, and negotiation; it cannot be fast-tracked
- **Internal governance conflicts** -- collective decision-making is powerful but also messy; disagreements about resource allocation, membership, and priorities can fracture communities
- **Market pressure** -- community-held assets exist within a capitalist economy that constantly exerts pressure to sell, develop, or extract; land trusts in gentrifying neighborhoods face intense pressure from developers
- **Undercapitalization** -- community-owned enterprises often struggle to access startup capital because they don't fit traditional lending criteria; they're too small for impact investors and too "business-like" for grant funders
- **Burnout** -- the relational, volunteer-intensive nature of many community asset management models leads to burnout among core organizers, especially in under-resourced communities

### Why This Matters

- Communities already have assets -- the question is how they're governed and who benefits
- Shifting from extraction-based to stewardship-based ownership changes everything
- These models build community wealth that stays local and compounds over time

## 8. Carbon & Biodiversity Credits

### What It Is

Market-based mechanisms that assign monetary value to ecological outcomes -- carbon sequestration, biodiversity preservation, ecosystem restoration -- and allow those values to be traded as credits.

### Carbon Credits -- The Basics

- **One carbon credit = one metric ton of CO2 equivalent** either removed from or prevented from entering the atmosphere
- **Compliance markets** -- legally mandated (cap-and-trade systems, like the EU Emissions Trading System)
- **Voluntary markets** -- companies and individuals purchase credits voluntarily to offset emissions
- Credits are generated through activities like reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, wetland restoration, and avoided deforestation

### Biodiversity Credits -- Emerging

- Newer than carbon credits and still developing standards
- Aim to quantify and compensate for biodiversity outcomes -- species preservation, habitat restoration, ecosystem health
- Frameworks being developed by organizations like the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and the Biodiversity Credit Alliance
- Potential to direct significant capital to land stewards and Indigenous communities protecting biodiversity

### Ecosystem Service Credits -- Broader

- Water quality and watershed protection credits
- Pollination services
- Soil health credits
- Coastal and wetland resilience credits

### The Tensions

- **Commodification risk** -- turning nature into a financial product can reduce living systems to line items on a balance sheet
- **Quality and integrity** -- many carbon credits have been found to be low-quality or fraudulent (phantom credits)
- **Who benefits?** -- credits often benefit intermediaries and large landholders rather than grassroots communities and Indigenous peoples doing the actual stewardship
- **Offsetting vs. reducing** -- credits can be used as a license to keep polluting rather than actually reducing emissions

### How to Access Credits -- What's Required

- **Data is the entry barrier:** To generate carbon or biodiversity credits, you need verified, quantified ecological data -- soil carbon measurements, species counts, canopy cover, water quality metrics. This requires monitoring equipment, technical expertise, and time.
- **Pooling across communities is often essential:** A single small farm or community forest may not generate enough credits to justify the cost of verification. Communities are increasingly pooling data and land across multiple sites to reach the thresholds that credit registries and buyers require.
  - **Example:** 20 small-scale regenerative farms in a bioregion might collectively pool their soil carbon data to register as a single carbon project, sharing the cost of third-party verification and accessing credit markets none could reach alone
- **Registry and verification:** Credits must be registered with a recognized standard body (e.g., Verra/VCS, Gold Standard, Plan Vivo, or newer frameworks like BioCarbon Registry). Each has different requirements, costs, and levels of community-friendliness. Plan Vivo is often cited as the most accessible for smallholder and community projects.
- **Costs:** Third-party verification can cost $30,000-100,000+; ongoing monitoring and reporting add annual costs. These upfront costs are a major barrier for communities without intermediary support.
- **Intermediaries:** Most communities access credit markets through project developers or aggregators who handle the technical, financial, and market-facing work. The quality and fairness of these intermediaries varies wildly -- some take 50-70% of credit revenue, leaving communities with a fraction of the value they create.

### Real-World Examples

- **Plan Vivo and Trees for Global Benefits (Uganda)** -- smallholder farmers in Uganda earn carbon credits through agroforestry and reforestation under the Plan Vivo standard; farmers receive direct payments based on trees planted and maintained, with community organizations handling aggregation and verification
- **Nori Carbon Removal Marketplace** -- a platform where regenerative farmers in the U.S. can sell carbon removal credits generated through soil carbon sequestration; designed to simplify the process and reduce costs for individual farmers
- **Livelihoods Carbon Fund** -- a blended finance fund that invests in community-level carbon projects (mangrove restoration, agroforestry, efficient cookstoves) in the Global South; community groups implement the projects and receive payments over 10-20 year periods
- **Regen Network** -- building a blockchain-based platform for ecological state verification; their CarbonPlus Grasslands protocol allows ranchers and land stewards to generate credits based on holistic land management data verified through satellite and ground monitoring
- **Yurok Tribe (California)** -- the Yurok Tribe developed one of the first tribally-led forest carbon offset projects in the U.S., generating carbon credits from sustainable management of their ancestral forest lands and using the revenue to fund cultural preservation and land reacquisition
- **Terra Global Capital & Rimba Raya (Borneo)** -- a community-supported REDD+ project protecting 65,000 hectares of tropical peat forest; local communities participate in monitoring and receive a share of credit revenue, though the project has also faced criticism about benefit-sharing equity

### Expanded Tensions & Challenges

- **The data divide** -- communities doing the most important ecological stewardship (Indigenous peoples, smallholder farmers, pastoralists) often have the least access to the monitoring technology and technical expertise needed to generate credits; this creates a paradox where the best stewards are the least rewarded
- **Intermediary extraction** -- project developers and carbon brokers often capture the majority of credit value; some models give communities as little as 10-30% of the final credit sale price
- **Permanence requirements** -- carbon credits typically require 25-100 year commitments to maintain carbon stocks; this locks communities into long-term land-use restrictions that may conflict with future needs or rights
- **Commodification of relationships** -- reducing the relationship between a community and their land to a set of carbon metrics can undermine holistic, relational approaches to stewardship that have worked for millennia
- **Verification as colonialism** -- third-party verification regimes require communities to prove their ecological outcomes to external auditors using Western scientific methods, often ignoring Indigenous and traditional ecological knowledge
- **Market volatility** -- carbon credit prices have swung wildly (from $5 to $50+ per ton and back); communities that build budgets around credit revenue face real financial risk when markets shift
- **Additionality debates** -- credits are supposed to fund ecological outcomes that wouldn't have happened otherwise; Indigenous communities who have been stewarding lands for generations face the absurd requirement of proving that their stewardship is "additional"
- **Offset legitimacy crisis** -- major investigations have found that a significant percentage of certified carbon credits do not represent real emissions reductions, undermining trust in the entire system and making it harder for legitimate community projects to compete

### The Opportunity for Communities

- When designed well and governed by communities, credits can direct real capital to land stewards
- Indigenous-led and community-governed crediting programs are emerging
- Bioregional crediting frameworks could bypass extractive intermediaries
- Stacking credits (carbon + biodiversity + water) on the same piece of land can increase value and incentivize holistic stewardship
- Verification and monitoring technology is improving (remote sensing, community-based monitoring)

## 9. Commitment Pooling

### What It Is

A practice where individuals and organizations make advance commitments of resources -- money, time, skills, land, or other assets -- into a shared pool, which is then deployed collectively based on community priorities.

### How It Differs from Traditional Fundraising

- **Pre-committed** -- resources are pledged before specific projects are defined, creating a flexible pool
- **Community-governed** -- the pool is directed by collective decision-making, not a single donor or board
- **Multi-resource** -- not just money; can include labor, materials, expertise, land access, equipment
- **Relational** -- commitments are made within a web of trust and mutual accountability

### Examples and Models

- **Giving circles** -- groups of people pooling donations and deciding together where to give
- **Cooperative investment clubs** -- pooling capital for community-directed investment
- **Mutual aid funds** -- pre-committed resources for community emergency response
- **Community shares / community investment** -- residents invest in local enterprises collectively
- **Resource pooling for land acquisition** -- multiple stakeholders committing funds toward community land purchase

### Real-World Examples

- **Boston Ujima Project** -- a community-controlled investment fund where residents of Boston's working-class neighborhoods of color vote on which local businesses and projects receive investment; members pool capital and make collective investment decisions through a democratic assembly process
- **The Working World** -- a non-extractive investment fund that pools capital to invest in worker-owned cooperatives in the U.S. and Latin America; investments are repaid from revenue (not personal guarantees), and the pooled fund has supported dozens of cooperative startups
- **Chamas (Kenya)** -- traditional savings circles where community members make weekly or monthly contributions to a shared pool; the pool rotates or is allocated collectively; this centuries-old model of commitment pooling has been adapted by Grassroots Economics into digital community currency systems
- **Firefly Community Fund (Vermont)** -- a community investment club where members pool monthly contributions and collectively decide on loans to local regenerative farms, housing cooperatives, and community enterprises
- **Northeast Farmers of Color Land Trust** -- used commitment pooling and collective fundraising from both community members and allied donors to acquire farmland for Black and Indigenous farmers in the northeastern U.S.

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Free rider problem** -- in any pooled model, there's tension between those who contribute more and those who contribute less; managing expectations and fairness requires strong governance
- **Decision-making friction** -- collective governance of pooled resources can be slow; when communities need to act fast (emergency response, time-sensitive land purchases), democratic process can be a bottleneck
- **Trust fragility** -- the entire model depends on trust; a single breach -- mismanaged funds, perceived favoritism in allocation, broken commitments -- can collapse the pool and damage community relationships
- **Legal and tax complexity** -- pooling money collectively exists in a legal gray area in many jurisdictions; structured wrong, it can trigger securities regulations, tax liabilities, or insurance requirements
- **Equity of contribution** -- not everyone can contribute equally; if governance power tracks with contribution size, wealthier members dominate decisions; if it doesn't, tensions arise about fairness
- **Scale ceiling** -- commitment pools tend to work well at small to medium scale (dozens to hundreds of members) but become harder to govern as they grow; scaling requires institutional infrastructure that can dilute the relational quality

### Why It Matters

- Shifts from reactive fundraising (scrambling for resources after needs arise) to proactive community resourcing
- Builds collective ownership and shared governance of capital
- Creates resilience -- pooled resources can respond faster than institutional funding cycles
- Strengthens relationships and trust within communities

## 10. How These Avenues Weave Together

None of these exist in isolation. The real power is in how they combine:

### A Practical Example

Imagine a bioregional community working toward land stewardship and food sovereignty:

1. **Flow Funding** provides unrestricted seed capital to a trusted community leader
2. **Commitment Pooling** gathers additional resources from community members -- money, labor, skills
3. **A Community Land Trust** is established to hold the land permanently outside of speculative markets
4. **Impact Investment** (patient, catalytic capital) funds infrastructure -- greenhouses, water systems, processing facilities
5. **Community Currency** enables local exchange of goods and services within the community
6. **Carbon and Biodiversity Credits** generate ongoing revenue from the ecological stewardship happening on the land
7. **A Bioregional Flow Fund** is created so this community can resource neighboring communities through the same trust-based model
8. **Green Bonds** at the municipal level fund public infrastructure (roads, water, energy) that supports the project

This is the regenerative capital stack -- multiple forms of capital flowing at different scales, speeds, and levels of formality, all in service of community-led regeneration.

## The Common Thread

Across all of these, several principles keep showing up:

- **Trust over bureaucracy** -- relationship and accountability to life, not compliance paperwork
- **Community governance** -- those closest to the need make the decisions
- **Bioregional orientation** -- organized around living systems and place, not political boundaries
- **Multiple forms of value** -- money is one form of capital; time, land, knowledge, relationships, ecological health are others
- **Non-extractive design** -- capital should circulate and regenerate, not accumulate and extract
- **Open-source and replicable** -- models should be shared so any community can adapt them

## What's Coming Next

This is the first of many deeper dives. In future Monday sessions, we'll explore each of these in detail:

- **Flow Funding deep dive** -- how it works in practice, how to start one, the playbook
- **Impact investment for communities** -- what structures exist, how to access them, what to watch out for
- **Carbon and biodiversity credits** -- how communities can participate, what's legitimate, what's greenwashing
- **Community currencies and tokenomics** -- design principles, real examples, how to build one
- **Commitment pooling and cooperative finance** -- practical frameworks for collective resourcing
- **Green bonds and municipal finance** -- how communities can advocate for and access public investment
- **Bringing it all together** -- designing a regenerative capital stack for your bioregion

## Closing

The old financial system wasn't built for us. But we don't have to wait for it to change. Communities are already building new pathways for capital to flow -- rooted in trust, governed by the people closest to the work, and designed to regenerate rather than extract.

Today was about seeing the landscape. The invitation going forward is to go deeper -- together.
