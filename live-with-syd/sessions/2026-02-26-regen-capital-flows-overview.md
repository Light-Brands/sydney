# Live with Syd -- Regenerative Capital Flows Overview

**Date:** February 26, 2026
**Series:** Monday -- Regenerative Capital Flows
**Session Type:** Foundational Overview
**Purpose:** Introduce the landscape of regenerative capital flows so participants understand the premise and basics of each avenue. Future sessions will go deeper into each one.

---

## Opening Frame

The way capital moves in the world today was not designed for communities, ecosystems, or the living systems we depend on. It was designed for extraction, accumulation, and centralized control.

Regenerative capital flows are about redesigning how resources move -- so that capital serves life, not the other way around.

Today we're going to walk through a landscape of different kinds of capital flows that communities can access, steward, and build with. This is a first pass -- an overview. In future sessions we'll go deep into each of these. The goal today is for everyone to walk away understanding the basics of what's available, what makes each approach distinct, and how they might weave together.

## 1. Flow Funding

### What It Is

A participatory, trust-based grantmaking model where unrestricted funds are moved directly to trusted community leaders -- no applications, minimal reporting, maximum trust.

### How It Works

1. **Identify** -- Trusted community leaders are identified through deep relational networks, Flow Fund Advisors, and existing Flow Funders
2. **Deploy** -- Unrestricted funds go directly to those leaders; they decide how, when, and where capital moves based on what their community actually needs
3. **Report** -- Lightweight, story-based accountability replaces heavy compliance paperwork
4. **Recommend** -- Flow Funders nominate the next cohort of recipients, creating a self-perpetuating decentralized network

### What Makes It Different

- **Invitation-driven**, not application-driven
- **Community-controlled** decisions, not foundation-controlled
- **Organized by bioregions** (natural ecosystems and culture), not political boundaries
- **Trust and relationship** govern the process, not bureaucracy and compliance

### Key Context

- Pioneered by Marian Rockefeller Weber in the early 1990s
- Kinship Earth has raised $800K+ since 2024 and deployed $370K+ to 23 Flow Funders across 12+ bioregions globally
- Real outcomes: freeze dryers for food sovereignty on reservations, protection of sacred waters in Minnesota, family food security programs, women-led permaculture gardens in Ecuador, landscape hubs across Cascadia

### Examples of Communities Tapping In

- **The Fountain Fund (Pine Ridge, South Dakota)** -- Flow Funders deployed capital for winter heating and a truck for food delivery to the Slim Butte Agricultural Program, directly addressing survival-level needs on a reservation
- **Regenerate Cascadia (Pacific Northwest)** -- Piloting 8 landscape hubs across the Cascadia Bioregion that coordinate regeneration and finance at a bioregional scale, all seeded through flow funding
- **East African Coastal Forest Women's Flow Fund** -- 10 women restoring ecosystems across five countries, resourced through Regenerosity as a Flow Funder
- **Tumianuma Women's Gardens (Ecuador)** -- Women cultivating permaculture food forests and cultural exchange, funded through a single unrestricted flow fund grant

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Trust is the infrastructure** -- the entire model depends on deep relational networks; without them, it can't function, and building those networks takes time
- **Legibility to institutional funders** -- the model's simplicity can be hard to explain to foundations accustomed to logic models, theories of change, and detailed outcome metrics
- **Scale vs. intimacy** -- as more Flow Funders are added, maintaining the relational depth that makes the model work becomes harder
- **Accountability without surveillance** -- lightweight reporting is a feature, not a bug, but it requires funders to genuinely trust communities, which challenges deeply ingrained philanthropic habits
- **Founder dependency** -- early-stage flow funding networks often depend heavily on a single connector or champion; building distributed leadership takes time

---

## 2. Bioregional Flow Funding

### What It Is

Flow Funding organized at the bioregional scale -- autonomous, place-based Flow Funds created by and for specific bioregional communities, with support from organizations like Kinship Earth serving as backbone infrastructure.

### How It Differs from Standard Flow Funding

- **Place-rooted** -- organized around watersheds, ecosystems, and cultural landscapes rather than political boundaries
- **Locally governed** -- each bioregional Flow Fund is autonomous, not controlled by a central body
- **Self-perpetuating** -- designed so communities can launch and sustain their own funds without ongoing dependency

### The Vision

A global network of bioregional Flow Funds -- each rooted in place, governed by trust, and connected to a shared learning community. Kinship Earth's role is to provide legal, educational, and relational backbone -- not to be the center.

### Key Points to Share

- Active bioregions: Cascadia, Northeast Turtle Island, Greater Tkaronto, Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico, East Africa
- Kinship Earth is developing a free, open-source Bioregional Flow Funding Playbook to help any community launch their own
- The goal: 20+ bioregional Flow Funds created within 5 years

### Examples of Communities Tapping In

- **Regenerate Cascadia** -- building a bioregional Flow Fund model across the Pacific Northwest with landscape hubs that coordinate regeneration at watershed scale
- **Jamaica (Rastafari Indigenous Village, Montego Bay)** -- post-hurricane recovery and Indigenous-led stewardship resourced through a bioregional flow funding relationship
- **Colombia (multiple bioregions)** -- bioregioning across Aguaclara, Sinu, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Bogota, and Cali, with forest and watershed restoration projects supported through bioregional flow funding
- **Northeast Turtle Island** -- launching Q1 2026 as a bioregional activation with mapping, collaboration, disaster preparedness, and Flow Funding readiness

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Legal complexity** -- each bioregional Flow Fund may need its own legal entity or fiscal sponsor, and regulatory frameworks differ by country and jurisdiction
- **Cultural translation** -- the concept of bioregions doesn't map neatly onto how most governments, foundations, or institutions organize their work; explaining it takes patience
- **Equity across bioregions** -- some bioregions have more access to existing wealth, networks, and infrastructure than others; without intentional design, the model could replicate existing inequities
- **Coordination without centralization** -- how do autonomous bioregional funds share learning and maintain coherence without creating a new bureaucracy?
- **Long timelines** -- building the relational trust, legal infrastructure, and community buy-in to launch a bioregional Flow Fund is a multi-year process, not a quick deployment

## 3. Traditional & Institutional Philanthropy

### What It Is

The conventional philanthropic system -- foundations, donor-advised funds (DAFs), family offices, and large institutional grantmakers distributing capital through formal application and reporting processes.

### The Basics

- **Foundations** hold endowments and distribute a portion annually (typically only ~5-7% of assets)
- **Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs)** allow individuals to make tax-deductible contributions to a fund, then recommend grants over time -- there is no legal requirement to distribute, so billions sit idle
- **Family Offices** manage wealth for high-net-worth families; some are moving toward values-aligned giving
- **Institutional Grantmakers** (Ford, Rockefeller, MacArthur, etc.) deploy large grants, often with significant compliance requirements

### The Structural Problems

- **93% of foundation assets locked in endowments** -- only ~7% flows out annually
- **Application burden** -- grassroots leaders spend enormous time writing proposals instead of doing the work
- **Top-down control** -- foundations decide what communities should prioritize
- **Exclusion** -- Indigenous peoples protect 80% of global biodiversity but receive less than 1% of climate finance
- **Siloed** -- organized by issue area (health, education, environment) rather than how communities actually live

### Why It Still Matters

- It's where the vast majority of philanthropic capital currently sits
- Reforming it from within -- through trust-based philanthropy, participatory grantmaking, and spend-down commitments -- can unlock enormous resources
- Some foundations are beginning to shift: MacKenzie Scott's direct giving, the Decolonizing Wealth movement, trust-based philanthropy networks
- Educating donors and foundations on flow funding is part of the work

### Examples of Shifts Happening

- **MacKenzie Scott** -- gave away $17+ billion in unrestricted, no-application grants directly to thousands of organizations, demonstrating that trust-based philanthropy can work at massive scale
- **The Trust-Based Philanthropy Project** -- a growing network of foundations committing to multi-year unrestricted funding, simplified applications, and power-sharing with grantees
- **NOVO Foundation** -- has provided $300K+ in grants to Kinship Earth specifically because of the flow funding model's trust-based approach
- **The Decolonizing Wealth Project (Edgar Villanueva)** -- reframing philanthropy as a tool for reparative justice, not charity; influencing how major foundations think about power and capital
- **Spend-Down Foundations** -- Atlantic Philanthropies spent down its entire $8 billion endowment rather than existing in perpetuity, proving foundations can deploy their full resources within a generation

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Power hoarding** -- most foundations are structurally designed to preserve their own existence and grow their endowments, not to distribute wealth
- **Performative reform** -- many institutions adopt the language of trust-based philanthropy without actually shifting power or reducing compliance burdens
- **The DAF problem** -- over $230 billion sits in donor-advised funds with no legal requirement to distribute; these function as tax shelters that may never reach communities
- **Inaccessibility for grassroots groups** -- most institutional philanthropy requires 501(c)(3) status, financial audits, and organizational capacity that grassroots groups don't have and shouldn't need
- **Issue siloing** -- foundations organized by program area (climate, health, education) can't fund the way communities actually live, which is intersectional and place-based
- **Donor ego and control** -- even well-intentioned philanthropy often comes with strings attached, naming requirements, or strategic preferences that override community wisdom

## 4. Impact Investment

### What It Is

Investments made with the intention of generating both financial returns and measurable social or environmental impact. It sits between traditional philanthropy (no return expected) and conventional investing (maximize financial return).

### The Spectrum

```
Pure Philanthropy <----> Concessionary Returns <----> Market-Rate Returns <----> Conventional Investing
(grants, no return)      (below-market, impact-first)  (competitive returns + impact)  (profit-only)
```

### Key Concepts

- **Impact-First** -- accepts lower financial returns in exchange for deeper impact
- **Finance-First** -- seeks market-rate returns while screening for social/environmental outcomes
- **Patient Capital** -- longer time horizons that match the pace of ecological and community regeneration (not quarterly returns)
- **Catalytic Capital** -- flexible, risk-tolerant capital that fills gaps the market won't -- often the first money in

### Blended Finance -- A Closer Look

Blended finance is one of the most important mechanisms for communities to understand because it's designed to bridge the gap between philanthropy and investment.

**How it works:** Philanthropic or public capital is used strategically to reduce the risk of an investment, which then makes it possible to attract private investors who otherwise wouldn't participate. The philanthropic capital absorbs the first losses or accepts the lowest returns, making the deal safer for everyone else.

**The structure typically looks like this:**

```
Layer 1 (highest risk, lowest return):  Philanthropic / grant capital -- absorbs first losses
Layer 2 (medium risk, medium return):   Concessionary / impact-first investors
Layer 3 (lowest risk, market return):   Private / institutional investors
```

**Why it matters for regenerative projects:** Most regenerative community projects -- land acquisition, regenerative agriculture, community housing, renewable energy -- are considered "too risky" or "too small" for conventional investors. Blended finance creates a structure where philanthropic capital de-risks the project enough that larger pools of private capital can flow in. A foundation might put in $500K as a first-loss guarantee, which then unlocks $5M in private investment for a community land trust or regenerative farm.

**Key example:** The Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance has designed blended finance instruments that have mobilized over $4 billion for climate projects in developing countries. At a community scale, organizations like RSF Social Finance and the Heron Foundation use blended structures to fund cooperatives, regenerative agriculture, and affordable housing.

### Relevance for Communities

- Can fund land acquisition, regenerative agriculture, community housing, renewable energy
- Growing interest from family offices and wealth managers in "beyond ESG" impact
- Blended finance can make community-scale projects investable when they otherwise wouldn't be
- Opportunity: designing investment vehicles that are community-governed and regenerative by design

### Examples of Communities Tapping In

- **RSF Social Finance** -- a social enterprise lending and investment fund that has deployed over $700 million in loans and investments to food systems, education, ecological stewardship, and arts organizations; uses a unique community-pricing model where borrowers and investors together set interest rates
- **The Boston Ujima Project** -- a community-controlled investment fund where low-income residents of color in Boston vote on which local businesses receive investment; blends philanthropy, community contributions, and impact investment
- **Iroquois Valley Farmland REIT** -- investors pool capital to purchase farmland and lease it to organic and regenerative farmers on long-term, affordable leases; farmers build equity without needing to buy land outright
- **The Runway Project** -- provides zero-interest loans to Black entrepreneurs, funded through a blend of philanthropic and investment capital, with no credit score requirements
- **Thousand Currents** -- provides long-term, flexible funding to grassroots groups in the Global South, blending philanthropic grants with impact-first investment to resource movements for food sovereignty, ecological regeneration, and economic justice

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Measurement burden** -- impact investment requires "measurable" outcomes, which often forces communities into metrics frameworks designed for investors rather than for the people doing the work
- **Structural mismatch** -- most impact investment vehicles require formal legal entities, audited financials, and a track record that grassroots communities don't have
- **Return expectations** -- even "patient" and "concessionary" capital still expects financial returns, which can create pressure on community projects that need time to mature
- **Scale bias** -- the impact investment industry is oriented toward deals of $1M+; community-scale projects needing $50K-$500K often fall through the cracks
- **Greenwashing and impact-washing** -- the label "impact investment" is applied broadly, including to investments that primarily benefit wealthy investors with marginal social impact
- **Who defines impact?** -- impact metrics are usually set by investors, not communities; what counts as "impact" may not reflect what communities actually value
- **Blended finance complexity** -- structuring a blended finance deal requires legal, financial, and relational sophistication that most community organizations don't have; the transaction costs can be prohibitive for small projects

## 5. Green Bonds & Bonds

### What It Is

Bonds are debt instruments -- you lend money to an entity (government, municipality, corporation) and they pay you back with interest over time. Green bonds are bonds specifically earmarked to fund environmentally beneficial projects.

### Types Relevant to Regeneration

- **Green Bonds** -- fund climate and environmental projects (renewable energy, clean water, sustainable land use)
- **Social Bonds** -- fund projects with positive social outcomes (affordable housing, food access, healthcare)
- **Sustainability Bonds** -- combine green and social objectives
- **Community Development Bonds** -- issued by community development financial institutions (CDFIs) to fund local projects
- **Municipal Bonds** -- issued by local governments; can fund public infrastructure, parks, water systems

### Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) -- A Closer Look

CDFIs are one of the most important and underutilized tools for communities seeking access to capital. They are mission-driven financial institutions -- banks, credit unions, loan funds, and venture capital funds -- that are specifically certified to serve low-income and underserved communities.

**How they work:**

- CDFIs receive capital from the federal government (through the CDFI Fund at the U.S. Treasury), banks (who get Community Reinvestment Act credit for investing in CDFIs), foundations, and individual investors
- They then lend that capital at fair terms to borrowers who can't access conventional financing -- small businesses, affordable housing developers, community facilities, cooperatives, farms
- CDFIs can also issue bonds (Community Development Bonds) and raise capital from socially motivated investors

**Why they matter for regenerative communities:**

- They are designed to serve exactly the communities that traditional banks won't -- rural areas, Indigenous communities, communities of color, low-income neighborhoods
- They offer flexible underwriting -- looking at community impact, not just credit scores and collateral
- They provide technical assistance alongside capital -- helping borrowers build organizational capacity
- There are over 1,400 certified CDFIs in the U.S., managing over $450 billion in assets

**Key CDFIs to know:**

- **Opportunity Finance Network (OFN)** -- the national network of CDFIs
- **Natural Capital Investment Fund** -- a CDFI focused specifically on rural and Appalachian communities
- **Craft3** -- serves the Pacific Northwest with lending for community development, small business, and clean energy
- **Native CDFIs** -- over 70 CDFIs specifically serving Native American and Indigenous communities (e.g., Lakota Funds, First Nations Oweesta Corporation)

### How to Access Bonds -- What's Required

Accessing bond financing is different depending on the type of bond and who's issuing it. Here's what communities need to know:

**Municipal Bonds:**
- Communities don't issue these directly -- local governments do. The role for communities is **advocacy**: making the case to city, county, or state officials that regenerative infrastructure projects (water systems, renewable energy, parks, food systems) should be funded through municipal bond issuances
- What's needed: organized community voice, clear project proposals, alignment with municipal priorities, and sometimes ballot measures for voter-approved bonds
- **Example:** Many municipalities issue "green municipal bonds" for parks, stormwater management, and clean energy -- communities can push for these to include regenerative agriculture, food forests, or community land trust infrastructure

**Green / Social / Sustainability Bonds:**
- These are primarily issued by large institutions (governments, development banks, corporations)
- Communities typically access the *benefits* of green bonds (funded projects) rather than issuing them directly
- However, CDFIs and community development organizations can issue smaller-scale bonds or bond-like instruments (community investment notes) that are accessible at a smaller scale
- What's needed: a CDFI or community development intermediary willing to structure the instrument, and investors (often foundations, banks, or mission-aligned individuals) willing to purchase

**Community Investment Notes / Community Development Bonds:**
- The most accessible bond-like instrument for communities
- CDFIs and community development organizations issue these as promissory notes, typically in denominations as low as $1,000-$20,000
- Investors (individuals, foundations, banks) purchase notes; the capital is then lent to community projects
- What's needed: a CDFI or community loan fund as the issuing entity, SEC compliance (though many qualify for exemptions), and a pipeline of community projects to fund
- **Parallel to credits:** Just as carbon and biodiversity credits require pooled data across many land-based communities to demonstrate sufficient impact, bond issuance often requires pooling multiple community projects together to reach the scale that makes the bond viable and attractive to investors. A single community garden can't issue a bond, but a CDFI lending to 50 community food projects across a bioregion can.

### Key Points

- The global green bond market has grown to over $4 trillion cumulative issuance
- These are primarily institutional tools -- but municipalities and CDFIs can issue smaller-scale bonds accessible to community-level projects
- The CDFI ecosystem is a critical bridge between institutional bond markets and community-level needs
- Opportunity: community-scale bond programs, citizen-backed bonds, and regenerative bond frameworks that direct capital to bioregional projects

### Why This Matters for Us

- Bonds can fund the kind of physical infrastructure communities need -- water systems, renewable energy, regenerative agriculture facilities, community land trusts
- CDFIs make bond-like instruments accessible at community scale
- Understanding bonds helps communities advocate for municipal and regional investment in regeneration
- New models are emerging that blend bond structures with community ownership

### Examples of Communities Tapping In

- **Calvert Impact Capital (now CNote)** -- offers Community Investment Notes starting at $20, with capital flowing to CDFIs that lend to affordable housing, small businesses, and community facilities nationwide
- **RSF Social Finance Social Investment Fund** -- investors purchase notes that fund regenerative agriculture, education, and ecological projects; over $200 million deployed
- **Washington, D.C. Green Bonds** -- the city issued green bonds to fund stormwater infrastructure, creating green jobs and improving water quality in underserved neighborhoods
- **Craft3 (Pacific Northwest)** -- a CDFI that has lent over $600 million to community development projects, small businesses, clean energy, and habitat restoration across Oregon and Washington
- **Native CDFIs** -- organizations like Lakota Funds (Pine Ridge, SD) and Four Bands Community Fund (Cheyenne River) provide lending and financial education to reservation communities, often the only source of fair capital available
- **Community-Supported Solar Bonds** -- cooperatives like Cooperative Energy Futures (Minnesota) issue community bonds so residents can collectively invest in and own local solar installations

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Scale threshold** -- bond issuance has high fixed costs (legal, compliance, structuring); projects often need to be pooled or aggregated to reach the minimum scale that makes a bond viable
- **Institutional gatekeeping** -- green and social bond standards are set by institutions (ICMA Green Bond Principles, Climate Bonds Initiative); communities rarely have a seat at the table when defining what qualifies
- **Debt burden** -- bonds are debt; they must be repaid with interest. Communities taking on bond-financed projects need reliable revenue streams, which can create pressure that conflicts with regenerative timelines
- **Accessibility** -- understanding bond structures requires financial literacy that is deliberately excluded from most public education; this creates barriers for grassroots leaders
- **Greenwashing** -- the "green bond" label has no universal enforcement; corporations have issued "green bonds" to fund projects with questionable environmental benefit
- **CDFIs are undercapitalized** -- despite their mission, CDFIs collectively manage a fraction of the capital in the conventional banking system; demand for community lending far exceeds supply
- **Regulatory complexity** -- issuing any bond-like instrument requires navigating securities law, which is expensive and time-consuming; this is a major barrier for smaller organizations

## 6. Regenerative Crypto & Community Currencies

### What It Is

Digital and local currencies, tokens, and decentralized financial tools designed to serve community coordination, local exchange, and regenerative outcomes -- rather than speculation.

### Key Concepts

- **Community Currencies** -- local or bioregional currencies that keep value circulating within a community (digital or physical)
- **Utility Tokens** -- digital tokens exchangeable for goods, services, or access within a specific community or network
- **Governance Tokens** -- tokens that grant decision-making power (voting rights) within a community or protocol
- **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)** -- community-governed treasuries and decision-making structures coordinated through smart contracts
- **ReFi (Regenerative Finance)** -- a movement within crypto/Web3 specifically focused on funding ecological and social regeneration

### Design Principles That Matter

- **Separation of economic and governance power** -- who can trade and who can vote should not be the same thing (to prevent plutocracy)
- **Anti-speculation safeguards** -- mechanisms that prevent hoarding and ensure currency circulates
- **Place-based design** -- currencies and tokens rooted in specific bioregions, not abstract global markets
- **Contribution-based** -- governance power earned through participation and stewardship, not purchased

### Examples of Communities Tapping In

- **Permatours (Northeast Turtle Island)** -- developing a dual-token system: Utility Tokens for marketplace exchange and Voice Tokens (non-transferable) for governance, with intentional separation of economic and governance power and anti-speculation safeguards
- **Grassroots Economics / Sarafu Network (Kenya)** -- deployed community inclusion currencies serving tens of thousands of users across informal settlements and rural communities; people trade goods and services using a local digital currency when national currency is scarce; has demonstrably increased local economic activity by 20%+ in participating communities
- **BerkShares (Berkshire County, Massachusetts)** -- a local paper currency accepted at over 400 businesses; $11 million in BerkShares circulated since 2006; keeps wealth cycling locally rather than leaking out to distant corporations
- **Celo** -- a mobile-first blockchain platform designed for financial inclusion; supports community currencies and stablecoins in places with limited banking infrastructure
- **Regen Network** -- blockchain infrastructure specifically for ecological data and regenerative credits; allows land stewards to tokenize ecological outcomes
- **Circles UBI (Berlin and beyond)** -- a crypto-based universal basic income experiment where every participant receives a regular issuance of personal tokens that can be traded within a web of trust
- **Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS)** and **timebanks** have operated for decades without any digital infrastructure -- hours of work are the unit of value; communities like Dane County TimeBank (Wisconsin) have thousands of members exchanging tens of thousands of hours of services

### Why This Matters

- Communities can create their own mediums of exchange that reflect their values
- Governance tokens can distribute decision-making power beyond those with money
- These tools can work alongside -- not replace -- national currencies
- The tech is maturing, but the design choices matter more than the technology

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Technical complexity and exclusion** -- blockchain-based tools require digital literacy, internet access, and devices; this can exclude the very communities they're meant to serve
- **Speculation capture** -- even well-designed community tokens can be captured by speculators if anti-hoarding mechanisms aren't robust enough
- **Regulatory uncertainty** -- governments and financial regulators are still figuring out how to classify community currencies and tokens; projects can face sudden legal challenges
- **Adoption chicken-and-egg** -- a community currency is only useful if enough people and businesses accept it; building that critical mass is the hardest part
- **Crypto's reputation** -- the broader crypto space is associated with scams, speculation, and environmental damage (from proof-of-work mining); regenerative projects must constantly distinguish themselves
- **Governance token concentration** -- if governance tokens are earned through participation but some people have more time and access to participate, governance power can still concentrate among the privileged
- **Sustainability of infrastructure** -- who maintains the technical infrastructure? Community currencies need ongoing development, hosting, and support, which requires funding and skills
- **Non-digital alternatives are undervalued** -- timebanks and LETS systems work beautifully without any blockchain; the push toward digital tools can overshadow simpler, more accessible models that already work

---

## 7. Community-Managed Assets & Local Exchange

### What It Is

The broader category of resources, tools, and systems that communities can directly manage, trade, and exchange with -- beyond currency. These are the tangible and intangible assets that communities already hold.

### Types of Community Assets

- **Land and natural resources** -- held through community land trusts, cooperatives, or commons frameworks
- **Community-owned enterprises** -- cooperatives, worker-owned businesses, community-owned renewable energy
- **Shared infrastructure** -- tool libraries, seed banks, community kitchens, maker spaces, shared vehicles
- **Knowledge and skills** -- training programs, apprenticeships, traditional ecological knowledge
- **Social capital** -- trust networks, mutual aid systems, relationship infrastructure
- **Time and labor** -- timebanks and labor exchanges where hours of work are the unit of value

### Key Frameworks

- **Commons-based governance** -- managing shared resources through community agreements rather than private ownership or government control
- **Cooperative ownership** -- democratic ownership models (worker co-ops, consumer co-ops, housing co-ops, multi-stakeholder co-ops)
- **Community Land Trusts (CLTs)** -- permanently removing land from speculative markets and holding it in trust for community benefit
- **Mutual aid** -- reciprocal resource sharing based on solidarity, not charity

### Examples of Communities Tapping In

- **Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative (Boston)** -- one of the most celebrated community land trusts in the U.S.; residents of a historically disinvested neighborhood won eminent domain authority and created a CLT that now holds over 225 permanently affordable homes, a community greenhouse, urban farms, and commercial space -- all governed by residents
- **Mondragon Cooperative Corporation (Basque Country, Spain)** -- a federation of over 80 cooperatives employing 80,000+ people across manufacturing, finance, retail, and education; demonstrates that cooperative ownership can operate at industrial scale while maintaining democratic governance
- **Cooperation Jackson (Jackson, Mississippi)** -- building a solidarity economy in one of the poorest cities in the U.S. through interconnected cooperatives (a community farm, a fabrication lab, a media cooperative), a community land trust, and mutual aid networks
- **Catawba Cultural Preservation Project (Catawba Nation, South Carolina)** -- the Catawba Nation is using digital governance tools and community-managed asset frameworks to protect and develop their own land, cultural resources, and economic infrastructure under tribal sovereignty
- **Northeast Kingdom Community Action (Vermont)** -- manages community-owned housing, food access programs, Head Start, weatherization, and economic development programs as integrated community assets
- **Seed libraries and seed banks** -- community-managed seed collections operating across hundreds of communities; keep seed genetics in the commons rather than under corporate patent; examples include the Richmond Grows Seed Lending Library and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault partnership networks
- **Permatours network (Northeast)** -- 40+ partner sites sharing tools, skills, volunteer labor, and mutual aid across the bioregion, demonstrating how a distributed network can function as shared infrastructure without centralized ownership

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Legal and governance complexity** -- community land trusts, cooperatives, and commons structures require specific legal formations, bylaws, and governance processes that take expertise and time to set up properly
- **The "tragedy of the commons" myth** -- there is persistent cultural skepticism that communities can govern shared resources effectively, despite centuries of evidence to the contrary (Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for demonstrating this)
- **Internal conflict** -- shared governance means shared conflict; cooperatives and CLTs require robust conflict resolution processes, and many struggle with this
- **Capital access** -- cooperatives and CLTs often can't access conventional financing because their ownership structures don't fit standard lending criteria; banks don't know how to underwrite them
- **Burnout and volunteer dependency** -- many community-managed assets depend on unpaid labor; without sustainable compensation models, key people burn out
- **Enclosure pressure** -- market forces constantly push toward privatization; community assets held in trust must be legally and culturally defended against being sold off
- **Scale vs. intimacy** -- the governance models that work for 20 households in a CLT don't necessarily work for 2,000; scaling community governance is an unsolved design challenge

## 8. Carbon & Biodiversity Credits

### What It Is

Market-based mechanisms that assign monetary value to ecological outcomes -- carbon sequestration, biodiversity preservation, ecosystem restoration -- and allow those values to be traded as credits.

### Carbon Credits -- The Basics

- **One carbon credit = one metric ton of CO2 equivalent** either removed from or prevented from entering the atmosphere
- **Compliance markets** -- legally mandated (cap-and-trade systems, like the EU Emissions Trading System)
- **Voluntary markets** -- companies and individuals purchase credits voluntarily to offset emissions
- Credits are generated through activities like reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, wetland restoration, and avoided deforestation

### Biodiversity Credits -- Emerging

- Newer than carbon credits and still developing standards
- Aim to quantify and compensate for biodiversity outcomes -- species preservation, habitat restoration, ecosystem health
- Frameworks being developed by organizations like the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and the Biodiversity Credit Alliance
- Potential to direct significant capital to land stewards and Indigenous communities protecting biodiversity

### Ecosystem Service Credits -- Broader

- Water quality and watershed protection credits
- Pollination services
- Soil health credits
- Coastal and wetland resilience credits

### How to Access Credits -- What's Required

Accessing credit markets is one of the more complex pathways. Here's what communities need to know:

**Data is the gateway.** To generate credits, you need verifiable data proving ecological outcomes -- how much carbon was sequestered, how much biodiversity was restored, how much water quality improved. This requires:

- **Baseline measurements** -- what was the state of the land before intervention?
- **Ongoing monitoring** -- regular data collection over years (not months) to demonstrate real change
- **Third-party verification** -- an accredited verifier must audit the data and certify the credits

**Pooling is often necessary.** A single small farm or community garden rarely generates enough credits to be worth the cost of verification. Communities often need to **pool data and land area across many sites** to reach the scale where credit generation is financially viable. This is similar to how bond issuance requires aggregating multiple projects to reach minimum scale.

**Standards and registries.** Credits must be registered with a recognized standard body:
- **Verra (VCS)** -- the largest voluntary carbon market standard
- **Gold Standard** -- emphasizes co-benefits (community development, biodiversity)
- **Plan Vivo** -- specifically designed for community and smallholder projects in the Global South
- **American Carbon Registry** and **Climate Action Reserve** -- U.S.-focused registries

**Project development costs.** Getting a credit project from concept to market typically costs $50K-$500K+ in development, validation, and verification -- before any credits are sold. This is why intermediaries, aggregators, and blended finance structures are often needed.

### Examples of Communities Tapping In

- **Plan Vivo projects worldwide** -- Plan Vivo was specifically designed for community-scale carbon and ecosystem service projects; examples include the Trees for Global Benefit program in Uganda (smallholder farmers planting trees and earning carbon credits) and the Scolel'te project in Chiapas, Mexico (Indigenous and campesino communities managing forests and earning credits since 1997 -- one of the oldest community carbon projects in the world)
- **Regen Network** -- blockchain-based infrastructure that allows land stewards to register ecological data and generate credits with lower intermediary costs; supporting projects in grassland and soil carbon
- **Nori** -- a carbon marketplace focused on soil carbon from regenerative agriculture; farmers in the U.S. Midwest are earning credits for no-till and cover crop practices
- **Indigenous-led conservation in the Brazilian Amazon** -- the Paiter-Surui people developed one of the first Indigenous REDD+ projects, earning carbon credits for protecting their forest from deforestation; however, they also experienced the tensions of credit markets (see below)
- **Great Bear Rainforest Carbon Project (British Columbia)** -- First Nations communities managing a massive carbon offset project in partnership with the provincial government, generating revenue from forest conservation
- **Savimbo (Colombia)** -- working with Indigenous and campesino communities to generate biodiversity credits using simple video monitoring of wildlife, paying communities directly for verified biodiversity outcomes
- **Bioregional crediting potential** -- the Bioregional Activation Event Series in the Northeast is exploring how multiple land-based communities could pool ecological data to collectively access carbon, water, and biodiversity credit markets

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Commodification risk** -- turning nature into a financial product can reduce living systems to line items on a balance sheet; many Indigenous communities and land stewards reject this framing entirely
- **Quality and integrity** -- investigations have found that a large percentage of carbon credits (some estimates suggest over 90% of certain categories) are low-quality, representing little or no real climate benefit; phantom credits, double-counting, and inflated baselines are widespread
- **Who benefits?** -- credit market intermediaries (brokers, developers, verifiers, registries) often capture the majority of value; the communities and land stewards doing the actual work may receive a small fraction of the credit price
- **Offsetting vs. reducing** -- credits can be used as a license to keep polluting rather than actually reducing emissions; this is a fundamental ethical tension
- **Data burden on communities** -- the monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) requirements are technically and financially demanding; small communities often can't meet them without external support
- **Permanence requirements** -- carbon credits often require commitments of 25-100 years; this can lock communities into land-use arrangements that may not serve future generations
- **Power asymmetry** -- credit markets are designed by and for institutions in the Global North; communities in the Global South generating credits often have little power to negotiate terms
- **The Surui cautionary tale** -- the Paiter-Surui carbon project, once celebrated as a model, faced challenges including illegal mining incursions, internal community disagreements about the project, and difficulties navigating the complexity of credit markets; it illustrates that even well-designed projects face immense structural pressures
- **Verification costs as gatekeeping** -- the $50K-$500K+ cost of project development and verification is itself a barrier that keeps grassroots communities out of credit markets unless they have an institutional partner

### The Opportunity for Communities

- When designed well and governed by communities, credits can direct real capital to land stewards
- Indigenous-led and community-governed crediting programs are emerging
- Bioregional crediting frameworks could bypass extractive intermediaries
- Stacking credits (carbon + biodiversity + water) on the same piece of land can increase value and incentivize holistic stewardship
- Verification and monitoring technology is improving (remote sensing, community-based monitoring, AI-assisted analysis) and costs are coming down
- New standards like Plan Vivo and platforms like Savimbo are designed specifically for community-scale participation
- Pooling across bioregional networks (like the Permatours network) could make credit access viable for small-scale land stewards who can't participate alone

## 9. Commitment Pooling

### What It Is

A practice where individuals and organizations make advance commitments of resources -- money, time, skills, land, or other assets -- into a shared pool, which is then deployed collectively based on community priorities.

### How It Differs from Traditional Fundraising

- **Pre-committed** -- resources are pledged before specific projects are defined, creating a flexible pool
- **Community-governed** -- the pool is directed by collective decision-making, not a single donor or board
- **Multi-resource** -- not just money; can include labor, materials, expertise, land access, equipment
- **Relational** -- commitments are made within a web of trust and mutual accountability

### Examples and Models

- **Giving circles** -- groups of people pooling donations and deciding together where to give
- **Cooperative investment clubs** -- pooling capital for community-directed investment
- **Mutual aid funds** -- pre-committed resources for community emergency response
- **Community shares / community investment** -- residents invest in local enterprises collectively
- **Resource pooling for land acquisition** -- multiple stakeholders committing funds toward community land purchase

### Examples of Communities Tapping In

- **Awesome Foundation** -- a global network of autonomous chapters, each with 10 "micro-trustees" who each contribute $100/month to a shared pool; each month the chapter gives away $1,000 to a community project, decided collectively. Over 1,000+ chapters have formed worldwide, demonstrating the simplicity and replicability of the commitment pooling model
- **Seeding Sovereignty (national/Indigenous-led)** -- pools resources from multiple sources (individual donors, foundation grants, community contributions) into a flexible fund governed by Indigenous leaders for rapid response to Indigenous community needs -- from legal defense to water protection to ceremonial support
- **East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative (Oakland, CA)** -- community members pool small investment commitments ($1,000-$10,000) to collectively purchase commercial real estate and ensure buildings stay community-owned; combines commitment pooling with cooperative ownership
- **Agroecology Fund** -- multiple foundations pool their grantmaking into a single fund governed collectively, supporting agroecology movements worldwide; demonstrates commitment pooling at the institutional level
- **Mutual aid funds during COVID** -- thousands of communities created rapid-response mutual aid funds where people pre-committed monthly contributions to a shared pot, distributed based on community need; many of these (like the Mutual Aid Hub network) have continued beyond the pandemic
- **Ujima Fund (Boston)** -- community members commit $50-$5,000 to a pooled investment fund, then vote democratically on which local businesses and projects receive investment; combines commitment pooling with community governance of capital

### Tensions & Challenges

- **Free-rider problem** -- some people benefit from the pool without contributing; this can erode trust and participation over time
- **Governance friction** -- deciding collectively how to deploy pooled resources requires governance structures; disagreements about priorities can fracture groups
- **Legal ambiguity** -- depending on how a pool is structured, it may trigger securities regulations, tax implications, or liability issues; many community pools operate in legal gray areas
- **Sustainability of commitment** -- initial enthusiasm is high but monthly contributions often decline over time; maintaining long-term commitment requires ongoing relational investment
- **Scale limitations** -- commitment pools work beautifully at small scale (10-100 people) but face coordination challenges as they grow; the governance overhead can become burdensome
- **Equity within the pool** -- if wealthier members contribute more, how is decision-making power distributed? One-person-one-vote? Proportional to contribution? These design choices have major implications for equity
- **Informality risk** -- many commitment pools operate informally (Venmo, shared bank accounts); this creates vulnerability around accountability, transparency, and legal protection

## 10. How These Avenues Weave Together

None of these exist in isolation. The real power is in how they combine:

### A Practical Example

Imagine a bioregional community working toward land stewardship and food sovereignty:

1. **Flow Funding** provides unrestricted seed capital to a trusted community leader
2. **Commitment Pooling** gathers additional resources from community members -- money, labor, skills
3. **A Community Land Trust** is established to hold the land permanently outside of speculative markets
4. **Impact Investment** (patient, catalytic capital) funds infrastructure -- greenhouses, water systems, processing facilities
5. **Community Currency** enables local exchange of goods and services within the community
6. **Carbon and Biodiversity Credits** generate ongoing revenue from the ecological stewardship happening on the land
7. **A Bioregional Flow Fund** is created so this community can resource neighboring communities through the same trust-based model
8. **Green Bonds** at the municipal level fund public infrastructure (roads, water, energy) that supports the project

This is the regenerative capital stack -- multiple forms of capital flowing at different scales, speeds, and levels of formality, all in service of community-led regeneration.

## The Common Thread

Across all of these, several principles keep showing up:

- **Trust over bureaucracy** -- relationship and accountability to life, not compliance paperwork
- **Community governance** -- those closest to the need make the decisions
- **Bioregional orientation** -- organized around living systems and place, not political boundaries
- **Multiple forms of value** -- money is one form of capital; time, land, knowledge, relationships, ecological health are others
- **Non-extractive design** -- capital should circulate and regenerate, not accumulate and extract
- **Open-source and replicable** -- models should be shared so any community can adapt them

## What's Coming Next

This is the first of many deeper dives. In future Monday sessions, we'll explore each of these in detail:

- **Flow Funding deep dive** -- how it works in practice, how to start one, the playbook
- **Impact investment for communities** -- what structures exist, how to access them, what to watch out for
- **Carbon and biodiversity credits** -- how communities can participate, what's legitimate, what's greenwashing
- **Community currencies and tokenomics** -- design principles, real examples, how to build one
- **Commitment pooling and cooperative finance** -- practical frameworks for collective resourcing
- **Green bonds and municipal finance** -- how communities can advocate for and access public investment
- **Bringing it all together** -- designing a regenerative capital stack for your bioregion

## Closing

The old financial system wasn't built for us. But we don't have to wait for it to change. Communities are already building new pathways for capital to flow -- rooted in trust, governed by the people closest to the work, and designed to regenerate rather than extract.

Today was about seeing the landscape. The invitation going forward is to go deeper -- together.
