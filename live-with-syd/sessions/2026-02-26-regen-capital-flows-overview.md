# Live with Syd -- Regenerative Capital Flows Overview

**Date:** February 26, 2026
**Series:** Monday -- Regenerative Capital Flows
**Session Type:** Foundational Overview
**Purpose:** Introduce the landscape of regenerative capital flows so participants understand the premise and basics of each avenue. Future sessions will go deeper into each one.

---

## Opening Frame

The way capital moves in the world today was not designed for communities, ecosystems, or the living systems we depend on. It was designed for extraction, accumulation, and centralized control.

Regenerative capital flows are about redesigning how resources move -- so that capital serves life, not the other way around.

Today we're going to walk through a landscape of different kinds of capital flows that communities can access, steward, and build with. This is a first pass -- an overview. In future sessions we'll go deep into each of these. The goal today is for everyone to walk away understanding the basics of what's available, what makes each approach distinct, and how they might weave together.

## 1. Flow Funding

### What It Is

A participatory, trust-based grantmaking model where unrestricted funds are moved directly to trusted community leaders -- no applications, minimal reporting, maximum trust.

### How It Works

1. **Identify** -- Trusted community leaders are identified through deep relational networks, Flow Fund Advisors, and existing Flow Funders
2. **Deploy** -- Unrestricted funds go directly to those leaders; they decide how, when, and where capital moves based on what their community actually needs
3. **Report** -- Lightweight, story-based accountability replaces heavy compliance paperwork
4. **Recommend** -- Flow Funders nominate the next cohort of recipients, creating a self-perpetuating decentralized network

### What Makes It Different

- **Invitation-driven**, not application-driven
- **Community-controlled** decisions, not foundation-controlled
- **Organized by bioregions** (natural ecosystems and culture), not political boundaries
- **Trust and relationship** govern the process, not bureaucracy and compliance

### Key Context

- Pioneered by Marian Rockefeller Weber in the early 1990s
- Kinship Earth has raised $800K+ since 2024 and deployed $370K+ to 23 Flow Funders across 12+ bioregions globally
- Real outcomes: freeze dryers for food sovereignty on reservations, protection of sacred waters in Minnesota, family food security programs, women-led permaculture gardens in Ecuador, landscape hubs across Cascadia

## 2. Bioregional Flow Funding

### What It Is

Flow Funding organized at the bioregional scale -- autonomous, place-based Flow Funds created by and for specific bioregional communities, with support from organizations like Kinship Earth serving as backbone infrastructure.

### How It Differs from Standard Flow Funding

- **Place-rooted** -- organized around watersheds, ecosystems, and cultural landscapes rather than political boundaries
- **Locally governed** -- each bioregional Flow Fund is autonomous, not controlled by a central body
- **Self-perpetuating** -- designed so communities can launch and sustain their own funds without ongoing dependency

### The Vision

A global network of bioregional Flow Funds -- each rooted in place, governed by trust, and connected to a shared learning community. Kinship Earth's role is to provide legal, educational, and relational backbone -- not to be the center.

### Key Points to Share

- Active bioregions: Cascadia, Northeast Turtle Island, Greater Tkaronto, Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico, East Africa
- Kinship Earth is developing a free, open-source Bioregional Flow Funding Playbook to help any community launch their own
- The goal: 20+ bioregional Flow Funds created within 5 years

## 3. Traditional & Institutional Philanthropy

### What It Is

The conventional philanthropic system -- foundations, donor-advised funds (DAFs), family offices, and large institutional grantmakers distributing capital through formal application and reporting processes.

### The Basics

- **Foundations** hold endowments and distribute a portion annually (typically only ~5-7% of assets)
- **Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs)** allow individuals to make tax-deductible contributions to a fund, then recommend grants over time -- there is no legal requirement to distribute, so billions sit idle
- **Family Offices** manage wealth for high-net-worth families; some are moving toward values-aligned giving
- **Institutional Grantmakers** (Ford, Rockefeller, MacArthur, etc.) deploy large grants, often with significant compliance requirements

### The Structural Problems

- **93% of foundation assets locked in endowments** -- only ~7% flows out annually
- **Application burden** -- grassroots leaders spend enormous time writing proposals instead of doing the work
- **Top-down control** -- foundations decide what communities should prioritize
- **Exclusion** -- Indigenous peoples protect 80% of global biodiversity but receive less than 1% of climate finance
- **Siloed** -- organized by issue area (health, education, environment) rather than how communities actually live

### Why It Still Matters

- It's where the vast majority of philanthropic capital currently sits
- Reforming it from within -- through trust-based philanthropy, participatory grantmaking, and spend-down commitments -- can unlock enormous resources
- Some foundations are beginning to shift: MacKenzie Scott's direct giving, the Decolonizing Wealth movement, trust-based philanthropy networks
- Educating donors and foundations on flow funding is part of the work

## 4. Impact Investment

### What It Is

Investments made with the intention of generating both financial returns and measurable social or environmental impact. It sits between traditional philanthropy (no return expected) and conventional investing (maximize financial return).

### The Spectrum

```
Pure Philanthropy <----> Concessionary Returns <----> Market-Rate Returns <----> Conventional Investing
(grants, no return)      (below-market, impact-first)  (competitive returns + impact)  (profit-only)
```

### Key Concepts

- **Impact-First** -- accepts lower financial returns in exchange for deeper impact
- **Finance-First** -- seeks market-rate returns while screening for social/environmental outcomes
- **Blended Finance** -- uses philanthropic or public capital to reduce risk and attract private investment into regenerative projects
- **Patient Capital** -- longer time horizons that match the pace of ecological and community regeneration (not quarterly returns)
- **Catalytic Capital** -- flexible, risk-tolerant capital that fills gaps the market won't -- often the first money in

### Relevance for Communities

- Can fund land acquisition, regenerative agriculture, community housing, renewable energy
- Growing interest from family offices and wealth managers in "beyond ESG" impact
- Challenge: most impact investment still flows to large organizations, not grassroots; terms and structures often don't fit community-scale projects
- Opportunity: designing investment vehicles that are community-governed and regenerative by design

## 5. Green Bonds & Bonds

### What It Is

Bonds are debt instruments -- you lend money to an entity (government, municipality, corporation) and they pay you back with interest over time. Green bonds are bonds specifically earmarked to fund environmentally beneficial projects.

### Types Relevant to Regeneration

- **Green Bonds** -- fund climate and environmental projects (renewable energy, clean water, sustainable land use)
- **Social Bonds** -- fund projects with positive social outcomes (affordable housing, food access, healthcare)
- **Sustainability Bonds** -- combine green and social objectives
- **Community Development Bonds** -- issued by community development financial institutions (CDFIs) to fund local projects
- **Municipal Bonds** -- issued by local governments; can fund public infrastructure, parks, water systems

### Key Points

- The global green bond market has grown to over $4 trillion cumulative issuance
- These are primarily institutional tools -- but municipalities and CDFIs can issue smaller-scale bonds accessible to community-level projects
- Challenge: most green bonds fund large-scale corporate or government projects, not grassroots regeneration
- Opportunity: community-scale bond programs, citizen-backed bonds, and regenerative bond frameworks that direct capital to bioregional projects

### Why This Matters for Us

- Bonds can fund the kind of physical infrastructure communities need -- water systems, renewable energy, regenerative agriculture facilities, community land trusts
- Understanding bonds helps communities advocate for municipal and regional investment in regeneration
- New models are emerging that blend bond structures with community ownership

## 6. Regenerative Crypto & Community Currencies

### What It Is

Digital and local currencies, tokens, and decentralized financial tools designed to serve community coordination, local exchange, and regenerative outcomes -- rather than speculation.

### Key Concepts

- **Community Currencies** -- local or bioregional currencies that keep value circulating within a community (digital or physical)
- **Utility Tokens** -- digital tokens exchangeable for goods, services, or access within a specific community or network
- **Governance Tokens** -- tokens that grant decision-making power (voting rights) within a community or protocol
- **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)** -- community-governed treasuries and decision-making structures coordinated through smart contracts
- **ReFi (Regenerative Finance)** -- a movement within crypto/Web3 specifically focused on funding ecological and social regeneration

### Design Principles That Matter

- **Separation of economic and governance power** -- who can trade and who can vote should not be the same thing (to prevent plutocracy)
- **Anti-speculation safeguards** -- mechanisms that prevent hoarding and ensure currency circulates
- **Place-based design** -- currencies and tokens rooted in specific bioregions, not abstract global markets
- **Contribution-based** -- governance power earned through participation and stewardship, not purchased

### Real-World Examples

- Permatours is developing a dual-token system: Utility Tokens for marketplace exchange and Voice Tokens (non-transferable) for governance
- Grassroots Economics in Kenya has deployed community inclusion currencies serving tens of thousands of users
- Celo, Regen Network, and Toucan Protocol are building ReFi infrastructure
- Local exchange trading systems (LETS) and timebanks have been operating for decades as non-digital community currencies

### Why This Matters

- Communities can create their own mediums of exchange that reflect their values
- Governance tokens can distribute decision-making power beyond those with money
- These tools can work alongside -- not replace -- national currencies
- The tech is maturing, but the design choices matter more than the technology

## 7. Community-Managed Assets & Local Exchange

### What It Is

The broader category of resources, tools, and systems that communities can directly manage, trade, and exchange with -- beyond currency. These are the tangible and intangible assets that communities already hold.

### Types of Community Assets

- **Land and natural resources** -- held through community land trusts, cooperatives, or commons frameworks
- **Community-owned enterprises** -- cooperatives, worker-owned businesses, community-owned renewable energy
- **Shared infrastructure** -- tool libraries, seed banks, community kitchens, maker spaces, shared vehicles
- **Knowledge and skills** -- training programs, apprenticeships, traditional ecological knowledge
- **Social capital** -- trust networks, mutual aid systems, relationship infrastructure
- **Time and labor** -- timebanks and labor exchanges where hours of work are the unit of value

### Key Frameworks

- **Commons-based governance** -- managing shared resources through community agreements rather than private ownership or government control
- **Cooperative ownership** -- democratic ownership models (worker co-ops, consumer co-ops, housing co-ops, multi-stakeholder co-ops)
- **Community Land Trusts (CLTs)** -- permanently removing land from speculative markets and holding it in trust for community benefit
- **Mutual aid** -- reciprocal resource sharing based on solidarity, not charity

### Why This Matters

- Communities already have assets -- the question is how they're governed and who benefits
- Shifting from extraction-based to stewardship-based ownership changes everything
- These models build community wealth that stays local and compounds over time

## 8. Carbon & Biodiversity Credits

### What It Is

Market-based mechanisms that assign monetary value to ecological outcomes -- carbon sequestration, biodiversity preservation, ecosystem restoration -- and allow those values to be traded as credits.

### Carbon Credits -- The Basics

- **One carbon credit = one metric ton of CO2 equivalent** either removed from or prevented from entering the atmosphere
- **Compliance markets** -- legally mandated (cap-and-trade systems, like the EU Emissions Trading System)
- **Voluntary markets** -- companies and individuals purchase credits voluntarily to offset emissions
- Credits are generated through activities like reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, wetland restoration, and avoided deforestation

### Biodiversity Credits -- Emerging

- Newer than carbon credits and still developing standards
- Aim to quantify and compensate for biodiversity outcomes -- species preservation, habitat restoration, ecosystem health
- Frameworks being developed by organizations like the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and the Biodiversity Credit Alliance
- Potential to direct significant capital to land stewards and Indigenous communities protecting biodiversity

### Ecosystem Service Credits -- Broader

- Water quality and watershed protection credits
- Pollination services
- Soil health credits
- Coastal and wetland resilience credits

### The Tensions

- **Commodification risk** -- turning nature into a financial product can reduce living systems to line items on a balance sheet
- **Quality and integrity** -- many carbon credits have been found to be low-quality or fraudulent (phantom credits)
- **Who benefits?** -- credits often benefit intermediaries and large landholders rather than grassroots communities and Indigenous peoples doing the actual stewardship
- **Offsetting vs. reducing** -- credits can be used as a license to keep polluting rather than actually reducing emissions

### The Opportunity for Communities

- When designed well and governed by communities, credits can direct real capital to land stewards
- Indigenous-led and community-governed crediting programs are emerging
- Bioregional crediting frameworks could bypass extractive intermediaries
- Stacking credits (carbon + biodiversity + water) on the same piece of land can increase value and incentivize holistic stewardship
- Verification and monitoring technology is improving (remote sensing, community-based monitoring)

## 9. Commitment Pooling

### What It Is

A practice where individuals and organizations make advance commitments of resources -- money, time, skills, land, or other assets -- into a shared pool, which is then deployed collectively based on community priorities.

### How It Differs from Traditional Fundraising

- **Pre-committed** -- resources are pledged before specific projects are defined, creating a flexible pool
- **Community-governed** -- the pool is directed by collective decision-making, not a single donor or board
- **Multi-resource** -- not just money; can include labor, materials, expertise, land access, equipment
- **Relational** -- commitments are made within a web of trust and mutual accountability

### Examples and Models

- **Giving circles** -- groups of people pooling donations and deciding together where to give
- **Cooperative investment clubs** -- pooling capital for community-directed investment
- **Mutual aid funds** -- pre-committed resources for community emergency response
- **Community shares / community investment** -- residents invest in local enterprises collectively
- **Resource pooling for land acquisition** -- multiple stakeholders committing funds toward community land purchase

### Why It Matters

- Shifts from reactive fundraising (scrambling for resources after needs arise) to proactive community resourcing
- Builds collective ownership and shared governance of capital
- Creates resilience -- pooled resources can respond faster than institutional funding cycles
- Strengthens relationships and trust within communities

## 10. How These Avenues Weave Together

None of these exist in isolation. The real power is in how they combine:

### A Practical Example

Imagine a bioregional community working toward land stewardship and food sovereignty:

1. **Flow Funding** provides unrestricted seed capital to a trusted community leader
2. **Commitment Pooling** gathers additional resources from community members -- money, labor, skills
3. **A Community Land Trust** is established to hold the land permanently outside of speculative markets
4. **Impact Investment** (patient, catalytic capital) funds infrastructure -- greenhouses, water systems, processing facilities
5. **Community Currency** enables local exchange of goods and services within the community
6. **Carbon and Biodiversity Credits** generate ongoing revenue from the ecological stewardship happening on the land
7. **A Bioregional Flow Fund** is created so this community can resource neighboring communities through the same trust-based model
8. **Green Bonds** at the municipal level fund public infrastructure (roads, water, energy) that supports the project

This is the regenerative capital stack -- multiple forms of capital flowing at different scales, speeds, and levels of formality, all in service of community-led regeneration.

---

## The Common Thread

Across all of these, several principles keep showing up:

- **Trust over bureaucracy** -- relationship and accountability to life, not compliance paperwork
- **Community governance** -- those closest to the need make the decisions
- **Bioregional orientation** -- organized around living systems and place, not political boundaries
- **Multiple forms of value** -- money is one form of capital; time, land, knowledge, relationships, ecological health are others
- **Non-extractive design** -- capital should circulate and regenerate, not accumulate and extract
- **Open-source and replicable** -- models should be shared so any community can adapt them

---

## What's Coming Next

This is the first of many deeper dives. In future Monday sessions, we'll explore each of these in detail:

- **Flow Funding deep dive** -- how it works in practice, how to start one, the playbook
- **Impact investment for communities** -- what structures exist, how to access them, what to watch out for
- **Carbon and biodiversity credits** -- how communities can participate, what's legitimate, what's greenwashing
- **Community currencies and tokenomics** -- design principles, real examples, how to build one
- **Commitment pooling and cooperative finance** -- practical frameworks for collective resourcing
- **Green bonds and municipal finance** -- how communities can advocate for and access public investment
- **Bringing it all together** -- designing a regenerative capital stack for your bioregion

---

## Closing

The old financial system wasn't built for us. But we don't have to wait for it to change. Communities are already building new pathways for capital to flow -- rooted in trust, governed by the people closest to the work, and designed to regenerate rather than extract.

Today was about seeing the landscape. The invitation going forward is to go deeper -- together.
