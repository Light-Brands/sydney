Live with Syd — Regenerating the World Together

Weekly co-creative live gatherings exploring regenerative capital, bioregional coordination, land stewardship, and collective resilience.

**Hero Paragraph:**
Beginning in February, I'm hosting a series of recurring, values-aligned live sessions designed to support grassroots communities, bioregional regeneration, and new systems of care and coordination.

These are not webinars.
They are living, relational spaces for learning, dialogue, and systems-building.

Each gathering weaves together education, storytelling, practical frameworks, open Q&A, and emergent collaboration — rooted in trust, reciprocity, and a shared commitment to life.
