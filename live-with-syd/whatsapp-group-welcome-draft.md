## Welcome Message (for group description / pinned post)

Hey beautiful humans — welcome to the Live with Syd the Squid community group!

This is a space for anyone who feels called to be part of what we're building together — whether you're curious about regenerative finance, land stewardship, bioregional coordination, or you just want to be around people who care deeply about the world and each other.

Here's what's alive right now:

**Live with Syd** — Weekly co-creative sessions where we learn, share, and build together:
- *Mondays* — Regenerative Capital Flows (unlocking funding for grassroots communities)
- *Wednesdays* — Planetary Party (bioregional coordination & ecosystem building)
- *Fridays* — Unified Sanctuaries (land stewardship & community living design)
- *Monthly* — Heart Sharing Circles (grounding, grief, collective care)

And the wider ecosystem we're weaving through:
- **Kinship Earth** — Trust-based flow funding reaching grassroots leaders across 12+ bioregions
- **Planetary Party** — A global coordination protocol rooted in celebration and collaboration
- **Permatours** — Hands-on permaculture events and mutual aid across the Northeast
- **Unified Sanctuaries** — Designing a regenerative village model in Southern Vermont

This group is your place to:
- Stay in the loop on upcoming sessions and gatherings
- Share ideas, resources, and reflections
- Connect with others doing this work in their own communities
- Propose topics, collaborations, or projects
- Ask questions and find your people

**A few things we hold here:**
We lead with trust, curiosity, and care. This is a space for real conversation — not sales pitches, not debates, not speculation. Speak from your own experience. Honor each other's time and stories. Stay curious, not combative. We're here to build something together, and everyone's voice matters.

No one needs to have it all figured out. If you're here, you belong here.

Drop a hello below and tell us:
- Where you're joining from
- What drew you to this space
- One thing you're excited about right now

So glad you're here. Let's go.

With love and squid ink,
Syd

You're invited to join the Live with Syd the Squid WhatsApp community — a gathering space for folks who want to get involved in regenerative projects, weekly co-creative sessions, and a growing ecosystem of people building a more beautiful world together.

We explore regenerative capital flows, bioregional coordination, land stewardship, and collective healing — through Kinship Earth, Planetary Party, Permatours, and Unified Sanctuaries.

Whether you want to listen, learn, contribute, or co-create — there's a place for you here. Come as you are.

Join us and say hello!
