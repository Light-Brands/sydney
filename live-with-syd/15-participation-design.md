## Who These Spaces Are (and Aren't) For

### These spaces are for people who are:

- Curious, collaborative, and values-aligned
- Oriented toward regeneration, not extraction
- Willing to listen, reflect, and co-create
- Comfortable with ambiguity and emergence
- Committed to care, consent, and respect

### These spaces are not for:

- Sales pitches or self-promotion
- Ideological debates or culture wars
- Financial speculation or get-rich-quick thinking
- Harassment, trolling, or domination behaviors
- People unwilling to honor shared agreements

---

## Tiered Participation Roles

To support flow and coherence, we use three lightweight roles:

### Listeners

- Join with mic muted
- Camera on or off
- Welcome to participate via chat

### Contributors

- Share reflections or questions when invited
- May be unmuted by moderators

### Presenters / Guests

- Offer short talks, practices, or case studies
- Confirmed in advance via the Speaker Intake form

Roles are fluid and emergent — this is about coordination, not hierarchy.

> This gives permission to manage the room without breaking the values of the space.

## Energy Exchange (Micro-Economics Layer)

These gatherings are offered in the spirit of generosity and reciprocity.

If you feel called to support:

- The facilitation
- The tech infrastructure
- The development of Unified Sanctuaries
- The Planetary Party ecosystem

You're welcome to contribute through:

- Sliding-scale donations
- Monthly stewardship memberships
- Project-specific funding pools

No one is turned away for lack of funds.

---

## Conflict & Accountability Pathway

If harm, discomfort, or conflict arises:

1. You're invited to message a moderator privately
2. Moderators may pause or redirect the session
3. In serious cases, participants may be muted or removed
4. Follow-up dialogue or repair may be offered when appropriate

Our intention is protection, learning, and restoration.

## What You'll Walk Away With

### From Mondays (Regenerative Capital Flows)

You may leave with:

- New funding models you can apply immediately
- Introductions to aligned funders or collaborators
- Clarity on next steps for your project
- Templates, tools, or case studies
- A stronger narrative for your work

### From Wednesdays (Planetary Party)

You may leave with:

- A role or guild invitation
- Governance tools you can adapt
- New collaborators in your bioregion
- Strategic clarity on systems change
- A felt sense of belonging to something larger

### From Fridays (Unified Sanctuaries)

You may leave with:

- Practical land access insights
- Governance and trust models
- New pathways into regenerative living
- Collaboration opportunities
- A real-world prototype to learn from

### From Heart Sharing Circles

You may leave with:

- A lighter nervous system
- Greater emotional clarity
- A sense of being witnessed
- Renewed energy for action
- Tools for ongoing self-regulation

---

## Lightweight Metrics / Impact

Over time, we'll track:

- Number of sessions held
- Number of participants engaged
- Cross-bioregional collaborations formed
- Funding pathways unlocked
- Land or infrastructure projects seeded
- Governance experiments launched
- Stories of personal and community transformation

Our metrics blend quantitative data with lived experience and narrative impact.

---

## Clarity Tweaks

### A. Dates & Timezones

All sessions should include clear dates, start times, and timezone information.

### B. Level of Depth Indicator Per Track

Example:

> Mondays — Regenerative Capital Flows
> Beginner-friendly · Practitioner-relevant · Strategically deep

This reduces intimidation for newcomers.

### C. Code of Generosity

> This space is rooted in generosity of spirit, curiosity of mind, and care for one another.
