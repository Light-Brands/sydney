## What Is Live with Syd?

A series of recurring live sessions — weekly gatherings around regenerative capital flows, Planetary Party ecosystem building, and Unified Sanctuaries (a land-based regenerative project), plus monthly non-recorded heartsharing circles.

These aren't webinars — they're participatory, values-aligned spaces for learning, co-creation, and real systems-building.

## Weekly Themes

| Day | Theme | Focus |
|-----|-------|-------|
| **Monday** | Regenerative Capital Flows | Unlocking capital for grassroots communities |
| **Wednesday** | Planetary Party | Bioregional coordination, culture, governance, regenerative finance |
| **Friday** | Unified Sanctuaries | Land stewardship, regenerative community, trust models |
| **Monthly** | Heartsharing + Grounding Circles | Non-recorded sacred container |

## Session Design Principles

These sessions are intended to be:

- **Participatory** — People can speak, share video, or just listen
- **Intentional** — Registration required to prevent spam and disruption
- **Co-creative** — People can apply to offer presentations or education
- **Discoverable** — Published afterward so others can join later or watch replays
- **Values-aligned** — Strong data privacy, ethical tech choices, no exploitative media rights clauses

## Values & Ethics Constraints

- No Zoom
- No platforms with predatory data usage
- No fine-print media ownership clauses
- Preference for open-source or privacy-first tools
- Full ownership of all recordings and content retained by Syd
- GDPR-friendly where possible

## Why This Stack Matches These Values

- Open source core (Jitsi, OBS)
- Sovereign content ownership
- No predatory data clauses
- Consent-first architecture
- Low cost, high trust
- Scales without selling your soul
- Keeps Syd in editorial control
- Supports emergence, not bureaucracy
